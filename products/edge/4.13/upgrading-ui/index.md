# Upgrading via the UI


Upgrade Leader and Edge Nodes in a Distributed deployment via the UI.

---

Cribl Edge offers a way to upgrade both your Leader and Edge Nodes in a Distributed deployment.

You can upgrade the Nodes either from Cribl CDP, or from packages downloaded to your system.

For Edge Nodes, you can specify the version to upgrade to per Fleet,
and upgrades will then be performed automatically by the Leader.

> If you need more control over the upgrade process, want to upgrade a Single-instance deployment,
> or a deployment in an air-gapped environment, an alternative is [upgrading manually](upgrading-manually) (via CLI).
