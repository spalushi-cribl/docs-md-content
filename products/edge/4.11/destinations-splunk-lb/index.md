# Splunk Load Balanced Destination


The **Splunk Load Balanced** Destination can load-balance the data it streams to multiple Splunk receivers. Downstream Splunk instances receive the data cooked and parsed.

{.box .info} 

Looking for a quick way to switch all of your S2S Destinations to Splunk HEC Destinations? Follow our how-to guide: [Switch Cribl Stream Destinations from S2S to Splunk HEC](/stream/s2s-to-hec). 

#### Splunk Cloud Platform

To establish secure connections to Splunk Cloud, you'll need to [configure SSL](#ssl) settings using the private and public keys from the Splunk Cloud Universal Forwarder credentials package.

For details on which Destination to use for Splunk Cloud, see [Splunk Cloud Platform and BYOL Integrations](/stream/usecase-splunk-cloud-integrations). The [Splunk HEC Destination](destinations-splunk-hec) is recommended for most use cases.

## Configure Cribl Edge to Load-Balance to Multiple Splunk Destinations

1. On the top bar, select **Products**, and then select **Cribl Edge**. Under **Fleets**, select a Fleet. Next, you have two options:
   - To configure via [QuickConnect](quickconnect), navigate to **Routing** > **QuickConnect** (Stream) or **Collect** (Edge). Select **Add Destination** and select the Destination you want from the list, choosing either **Select Existing** or **Add New**. 
   - To configure via the [Routes](routes), select **Data** > **Destinations** or **More** > **Destinations** (Edge). Select the Destination you want. Next, select **Add Destination**.
2. In the **New Destination** modal, configure the following under **General Settings**:
   - **Output ID**: Enter a unique name to identify this Splunk LB Destination definition. If you clone this Destination, Cribl Edge will add `-CLONE` to the original **Output ID**.
   - **Description**: Optionally, enter a description.
   - **Indexer discovery**: When enabled, Cribl Edge will automatically discover the indexers in an indexer clustering environment. </<br> This hides both **Exclude current host IPs** and the [**Destinations**](#destinations) section, and displays the following fields:</br>
   - **Site**: Clustering site whose indexers need to be discovered. In the case of a single site cluster, `default` is the default entry.
   - **Cluster Manager URI**: Full URI of Splunk cluster manager, in the format: `scheme://host:port`. (Edge Nodes normally access the cluster manager on **port 8089** to get the list of currently online indexers.)
   - **Refresh period**: Time interval (in seconds) between two consecutive fetches of the indexer list from the cluster manager. Defaults to `300` seconds (five minutes). 
   - **Validate cluster manager certificates**: If toggled on (default), Cribl Edge is configured to reject any cluster manager certificate during indexer discovery that is not authorized by your system's Certificate Authority (CA). Cribl strongly recommends the default setting unless you must allow untrusted (for example, self-signed) certificates.
3. Under **Authentication tokens**, select one of the **Authentication method** options for [authenticating to the cluster manager](#enabling-cluster-master-authentication) for indexer discovery:
   - **Manual**: In the resulting **Auth token** field, enter the required token.
   - **Secret**: This option exposes an **Auth token (text secret)** drop-down, from which you can select a [stored secret](/stream/securing-secrets) that references the auth token. A **Create** link is available to store a new, reusable secret.

      <br>If you use multiple cluster managers, you can add multiple tokens to cycle through them if a connection to the primary cluster manager fails. Select **Add token** to configure another authentication token. </br>
      <br>

     > Each Worker Process performs its own indexer discovery according to the above settings.
     >
     {.box .success}
      </br>
 
 4. The **Destinations** section appears only when **Indexer discovery** is toggled off (default). Here, you specify a known set of Splunk receivers on which to load-balance data. Then you assign a weight to Cribl Edge's connection to each receiver. The higher the weight assigned to a given connection, the more traffic Cribl Edge will attempt to allocate to that connection. Click **Add Destination** to specify more receivers on new rows. Each row provides the following fields:
     - **Address**: Hostname or IP address of the receiver. If you enter a hostname, Cribl Edge tries to resolve it to its IP address or addresses. If a hostname has multiple A records – that is, if multiple receivers are behind it – Cribl Edge will assign the weight you assigned to the host to all of its IP addresses.
     - **Port**: Port number to send data to.
     - **TLS**: Whether to inherit TLS configs from group setting, or disable TLS. Defaults to `inherit`.
     - **TLS servername**: Servername to use if establishing a TLS connection. If not specified, defaults to the connection host (if not an IP). Otherwise, uses the global TLS settings. 
     - **Load weight**: Set the relative traffic-handling capability for each connection by assigning a weight greater than `0`.
       For details, see [Destinations]{#destinations} below.
5. Next, you can configure the following **Optional Settings**: 
      - **Exclude current host IPs**: Enable if you want to exclude all the current host's IP addresses from the list of resolved hostnames.
      - **Backpressure behavior**: Select whether to block, drop, or queue events when all receivers in this group are exerting backpressure. (Causes might include a broken or denied connection, or a rate limiter.) Defaults to `Block`. When toggled to `Persistent Queue`, adds the [Persistent Queue Settings](#pq) section (left tab) to the modal.
      - **Tags**: Optionally, add tags that you can use to filter and group Destinations on the **Destinations** page. These tags aren't added to processed events. Use a tab or hard return between (arbitrary) tag names.
6. Optionally, you can adjust the [Persistent Queue](#pq), [TLS](#tls), [Processing](#processing), [Timeout](#timeout), and [Advanced](#advanced-tab) settings outlined in the sections below.
7. Select **Save**, then **Commit & Deploy**. 

### Destinations {#destinations}

* For best results, the weights for all connections should have the same order of magnitude. For example, if you have three connections, weights of `10`, `50`, and `40` would work; so would weights of `1`, `5`, and `4` – but weights like `10`, `120`, and `9` mix different orders of magnitude and should be avoided.
  
* You can add connections and keep them unused except for special circumstances such as testing. Just assign these connections a weight of `0` and Cribl Edge will ignore them. When you want to use such a "parked" connection, assign it a weight greater than `0`.

The final column provides an `X` button to delete any row from the **Destinations** table.

#### Enabling Cluster Manager Authentication  {#enabling-cluster-master-authentication}

To enable token authentication on the Splunk cluster manager, you can find complete instructions in Splunk's [Enable or Disable Token Authentication](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/EnableTokenAuth) documentation. This option requires Splunk 7.3.0 or higher, and requires the following [capabilites](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/Rolesandcapabilities): `list_indexer_cluster` and `list_indexerdiscovery`.

For details on creating the token, see Splunk's [Create Authentication Tokens](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.1.1/Security/CreateAuthTokens) topic – especially its section on how to [Configure Token Expiry and "Not Before" Settings](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.1.1/Security/CreateAuthTokens#Configure_token_expiry_and_.22Not_Before.22_settings).

> Be sure to give the token an **Expiration** setting well in the future, whether you use **Relative Time** or **Absolute Time**. Otherwise, the token will inherit Splunk's default expiration time of `+30d` (30 days in the future), which will cause indexer discovery to fail.
>
{.box .warning}

If you have a failover site configured on Splunk's cluster manager, Cribl respects this configuration, and forwards the data to the failover site in case of site failure.

### Persistent Queue Settings {#pq}

[Snippet not found: content/shared/4.11/snippets/_destinations-persistent-queue-settings.md]

### TLS Settings (Client Side) {#tls}

**Enabled**: Defaults to toggled off. When toggled on:

**Validate server certs**: Reject any server (indexer) certificate that is not authorized by a CA in the **CA certificate path** or by another trusted CA (such as the CA for your system). Defaults to toggled on.

**Server name (SNI)**: Server name for the SNI (Server Name Indication) TLS extension. This must be a host name, not an IP address.

**Minimum TLS version**: Optionally, select the minimum TLS version to use when connecting.

**Maximum TLS version**: Optionally, select the maximum TLS version to use when connecting.

**Certificate name**: The name of the predefined certificate.
 
**CA certificate path**: Path on client containing CA certificates (in PEM format) to use to verify the server's cert. Path can reference `$ENV_VARS`.
 
**Private key path (mutual auth)**: Path on client containing the private key (in PEM format) to use.  Path can reference `$ENV_VARS`. **Use only if mutual auth is required**.
 
**Certificate path (mutual auth)**: Path on client containing certificates in (PEM format) to use. Path can reference `$ENV_VARS`. **Use only if mutual auth is required**. 
 
**Passphrase**: Passphrase to use to decrypt private key. Often the value of the `sslPassword` or similar parameter in the `outputs.conf` or `server.conf` file.

> ##### Single PEM File
>
> If you have a **single** `.pem` file containing `cacert`, `key`, and `cert` sections, enter this file's path in all of these fields above: **CA certificate path**, **Private key path (mutual auth)**, and **Certificate path (mutual auth)**.
>
{.box .info}

### Timeout Settings {#timeout}

  * **Connection timeout**: Amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the connection to establish, before retrying. Defaults to `10000` ms.

  * **Write timeout**: Amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for a write to complete, before assuming connection is dead. Defaults to `60000` ms.

### Processing Settings {#processing}

#### Post-Processing

**Pipeline**: [Pipeline](pipelines) or [Pack](packs) to process data before sending the data out using this output.

**System fields**: A list of fields to automatically add to events that use this output. By default, includes `cribl_pipe` (identifying the Cribl Edge Pipeline that processed the event). Supports wildcards. Other options include:

- `cribl_host` – Cribl Edge Node that processed the event.
- `cribl_input` – Cribl Edge Source that processed the event.
- `cribl_output` – Cribl Edge Destination that processed the event.
- `cribl_route` – Cribl Edge Route (or QuickConnect) that processed the event.
- `cribl_wp` – Cribl Edge Worker Process that processed the event.

### Advanced Settings {#advanced-tab}

**Output multiple metrics**: Toggle on to output multiple-measurement metric data points. (Supported in Splunk 8.0 and above, this format enables sending multiple metrics in a single event, improving the efficiency of your Splunk capacity.)

**Minimize in-flight data loss**: If toggled on (default), Cribl Edge will check whether the indexer is shutting down, and if so, will stop sending data. This helps minimize data loss during shutdown. (Note that Splunk logs will indicate that the Cribl app has set `UseAck` to `true`, even though Cribl does not enable full `UseAck` behavior.) If toggled off, exposes the following alternative option: {{< id `ack` >}}

**Max failed health checks**: Displayed (and set to `1` by default) only if **Minimize in‑flight data loss** is disabled. This option sends periodic requests to Splunk once per minute, to verify that the Splunk endpoint is still alive and can receive data. Its value governs how many failed requests Cribl Edge will allow before closing this connection. 

> A low threshold value improves connections' resilience, but by proliferating connections, this can complicate troubleshooting. Set to `0` to disable health checks entirely – here, if the connection to Splunk is forcibly closed, you risk some data loss.
>
{.box .warning}

**Max S2S version**: The highest version of the Splunk-to-Splunk protocol to expose during handshake. Defaults to `v4`; `v3` is also available.

**DNS resolution period (seconds)**: Re-resolve any hostnames after each interval of this many seconds, and pick up destinations from A records. Defaults to `600` seconds.

**Load balance stats period (seconds)**: How far back in time to keep traffic stats for load balancing purposes. Defaults to `300` seconds (five minutes).

**Max connections**: Constrains the number of concurrent indexer connections, per Worker Process, to limit memory utilization. If set to a number &gt; `0`, then on every DNS resolution period (or indexer discovery), Cribl Edge will randomly select this subset of discovered IPs to connect to. Cribl Edge will rotate IPs in future resolution periods – monitoring weight and historical data, to ensure fair load balancing of events among IPs.

**Nested field serialization**: Specifies whether and how to serialize nested fields into index-time fields. Select `None` (the default) or `JSON`.

**Authentication method**: Use the buttons to select one of these options:

- **Manual**: In the resulting **Auth token** field, enter the shared secret token to use when establishing a connection to a Splunk indexer.

- **Secret**: This option exposes an **Auth token (text secret)** drop-down, in which you can select a [stored secret](/stream/securing-secrets) that references the auth token described above. A **Create** link is available to store a new, reusable secret.

**Compression**: This setting controls compression for Splunk-to-Splunk `v4` data. Select the **Compression** type from the drop-down list:
- `Disabled`: Compression is turned off. This is the default setting for both existing and new Destinations in Cribl Edge versions 4.11 and older. Connections will be closed if the server attempts to use compression.
- `Always`: Cribl Edge will always send compressed data, regardless of the receiver's compression configuration.

This setting is not available when **Max S2S version** is set to `v3`.

**Log failed requests to disk**: Toggle on to make the payload of the most recently failed request available for inspection. See [Inspect Payload to Troubleshoot Closed Connections](#log-payload) below.

{{< id `grace` >}} **Endpoint health fluctuation time allowance (ms)**: How long (in milliseconds) each receiver endpoint can report blocked, before this Destination as a whole reports unhealthy, blocking senders. (Grace period for transient fluctuations.) Use `0` to disable the allowance; default is `100` ms; maximum allowed value is `60000` ms (1 minute).

**Throttling**: Throttle rate, in bytes per second. Multiple byte units such as KB, MB, GB, and so forth, are also allowed – for example, `42 MB`. A value of `0` (the default) indicates no throttling. When throttling is engaged, excess data will be dropped only if **Backpressure behavior** is set to **Drop events**. (Data will be blocked for all other **Backpressure behavior** settings.)

* The throttling rate is applied per Worker Process, per configured endpoint. For example, if you have two Worker Processes, each with two endpoints, and you set the throttling rate to `3 MB`, the total potential throughput rate is 12 MB per second: up to 3 MB per second for each of the four endpoints. The **Max connections** setting is also applied per Worker Process. To continue the example, if you set **Max connections** to `1`, the total potential throughput is 6 MB per second, even though each Worker Process has two configured endpoints.

* The throttling rate is applied after compression.

**Environment**: If you're using GitOps, optionally use this field to specify a single Git branch on which to enable this configuration. If empty, the config will be enabled everywhere.

#### Inspect Payload to Troubleshoot Closed Connections {#log-payload}

When a downstream receiver closes connections from this Destination (or just stops responding), inspecting the payload of the most recently failed request can help you find the cause. For example:

* Suppose you send an event whose size is larger than the downstream receiver can handle. 
* Suppose you send an event that has a `number` field, but the value exceeds the highest number that the downstream receiver can handle.

When **Log failed requests to disk** is enabled, you can inspect the last failed request payload. Here is how:

1. In the Destination UI, navigate to the **Logs** tab.
2. Find a log entry with a `connection error` message. 
3. Expand the log entry. 
4. If the message includes the phrase `See payload file for more info`, note the path in the `file` field on the next line.

Now you have the path to the directory where Cribl Edge is storing the payload from the last failed request.

##  SSL Configuration for Splunk Cloud {#ssl}

To connect to Splunk Cloud, you will need to extract the private and public keys from the Splunk-provided Splunk Cloud Universal Forwarder [credentials package](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Forwarder/latest/Forwarder/ConfigSCUFCredentials). You will also need to reference the CA Certificate located in the same package. 

You can reuse many of the settings in this Splunk Cloud package to set up Splunk Cloud Destinations. Use the following steps:

**Step 1**. Extract the `splunkclouduf.spl` package on the Cribl Edge instance that you will be connecting to Splunk Cloud. You will have a folder that looks something like this:

```shell
100_my-splunk-cloud_splunkcloud
	/default/
 		outputs.conf
		limits.conf
		your-splunk-cloud_server.pem
		your-splunk-cloud_cacert.pem
```

**Step 2**. (optional) Test connectivity to Splunk Cloud, using the Root CA certificate:

```shell
echo | openssl s_client -CAfile 100_<your-splunk-cloud>_splunkcloud/default/my-splunk-cloud_cacert.pem -connect inputs1.<your-splunk-cloud>.splunkcloud.com:9997 
```

To test the connection, you can use any of the URLs listed in the `[tcpout:splunkcloud]` stanza's `outputs.conf` section.

> You can simplify Steps [3](#private-key) and [4](#public-key) below by dragging and dropping (or uploading) the `.pem` files into Cribl Edge's **New Certificates** modal. See [Configure TLS for API and UI Access](securing-tls).
>
{.box .success}

{{< id `private-key` >}} **Step 3**. Extract the private key from the Splunk Cloud certificate. At the prompt, you will need the `sslPassword `value from the `outputs.conf`. Using Elliptic Curve keys: 

```shell
openssl ec -in 100_<your-splunk-cloud>_splunkcloud/default/<your-splunk-cloud>_server_cert.pem -out private.pem
```

If you are using RSA keys, instead use:

```shell
openssl rsa -in 100_<your-splunk-cloud>_splunkcloud/default/<your-splunk-cloud>_server_cert.pem -out private.pem
```

{{< id `public-key` >}} **Step 4**. Extract the public key for the Server Certificate: 

```shell
openssl x509 -in 100_<your-splunk-cloud>_splunkcloud/default/<your-splunk-cloud>_server_cert.pem -out server.pem
```

**Step 5**. In the Splunk Load Balanced Destination's TLS Settings (Client Side) section, enter the following:

*   CA Certificate Path: Path to `<your-splunk-cloud>_cacert.pem`.
*   Private Key Path (mutual auth): Path to 
`private.pem` ([Step 3](#private-key) above).
*   Certificate Path (mutual auth): Path to
`server.pem` ([Step 4](#public-key) above).

> In a [distributed deployment](/stream/deploy-distributed), enter this Destination configuration on each Worker Group/Fleet that forwards to Splunk Cloud. Then commit and deploy your changes.
>
{.box .success}

**Step 6**. In a [distributed deployment](/stream/deploy-distributed), enable [Worker UI access](/stream/setting-up-leader-and-worker-nodes#teleporting), and verify that the Certificate files have been distributed to individual workers. If they are not present, copy the Certificate files to the Workers, using exactly the same paths you used at the Group level.

## Notes About Forwarding to Splunk

- Data sent to Splunk is **not** compressed.

- The only `ack` from indexers that Cribl Edge listens for and acts upon is the shutdown signal described in [Minimize in‑flight data loss](#ack) above.

- If events have a Cribl Edge internal field called `__criblMetrics`, they'll be forwarded to Splunk as metric events.

- If events do not have a `_raw` field, they'll be serialized to JSON prior to sending to Splunk.

- You can copy and paste the Splunk Cloud servers from the `[tcpout:splunkcloud]` stanza into **General Settings > Destinations**. For example, from the example stanza below, you would copy only the bolded contents:

  <div class="code-no-ligatures">

  ~~[tcpout:splunkcloud]~~

  ~~server =~~ **inputs1.your-splunk-cloud.splunkcloud.com:9997, inputs2.your-splunk-cloud.splunkcloud.com:9997, inputs3.your-splunk-cloud.splunkcloud.com:9997, inputs4.your-splunk-cloud.splunkcloud.com:9997, inputs5.your-splunk-cloud.splunkcloud.com:9997, inputs6.your-splunk-cloud.splunkcloud.com:9997, inputs7.your-splunk-cloud.splunkcloud.com:9997, inputs8.your-splunk-cloud.splunkcloud.com:9997, inputs9.your-splunk-cloud.splunkcloud.com:9997, inputs10.your-splunk-cloud.splunkcloud.com:9997, inputs11.your-splunk-cloud.splunkcloud.com:9997, inputs12.your-splunk-cloud.splunkcloud.com:9997, inputs13.your-splunk-cloud.splunkcloud.com:9997, inputs14.your-splunk-cloud.splunkcloud.com:9997, inputs15.your-splunk-cloud.splunkcloud.com:9997**

  ~~compressed = false~~

  </div>

- From `limits.conf`, copy the `[thruput]` value, then paste it into **Advanced Settings > Throttling**.

- If you enable both (1) indexer discovery and (2) TLS with certificate validation, you see might errors. This happens because the IPs discovered (by default) for the indexers will not match the fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) referenced by the indexer certificates. This causes the TLS handshake to fail.


    - As a workaround, use `server.conf` on each indexer, setting `register_forwarder_address = <your.idx.fqdn>`. Cribl Edge will now get that value, and the certificates will match.

- See [Splunk's documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/latest/Data/Configureindex-timefieldextraction#Add_an_entry_to_fields.conf_for_the_new_field) on editing `fields.conf` to ensure the visibility of index-time fields sent to Splunk by Cribl Edge.
