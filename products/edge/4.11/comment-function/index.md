# Comment


The Comment Function adds a text comment in a Pipeline. It makes no changes to event data. The added comment is visible only within the Pipeline UI, where it is useful for labeling Pipeline steps. The Comment Function always has a minimum, non-zero processing time.

## Usage

**Comment**: Add your comment as plain text in this field.
