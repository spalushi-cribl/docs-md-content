# Filesystem/NFS


**Filesystem** is a non-streaming Destination type that Cribl Edge can use to output files to a local file system or a network-attached file system (NFS).

## Configuring Cribl Edge to Output to Filesystem Destinations

From the top nav, click **Manage**, then select a **Fleet** to configure. Next, you have two options:

To configure via the graphical [QuickConnect](quickconnect) UI, click Routing > QuickConnect (Stream) or Collect (Edge). Next, click **Add Destination** at right. From the resulting drawer's tiles, select **Filesystem**. Next, click either **Add Destination** or (if displayed) **Select Existing**. The resulting drawer will provide the options below.

 
Or, to configure via the [Routing](routes) UI, click **Data** > **Destinations** (Stream) or **More** > **Destinations** (Edge). From the resulting page's tiles or the **Destinations** left nav, select **Filesystem**. Next, click **Add Destination** to open a **New Destination** modal that provides the options below.

### General Settings

**Output ID**: Enter a unique name to identify this Filesystem definition. 

**Output location**: Final destination for the output files. 

**Data format**: The output data format defaults to `JSON`. `Raw` and `Parquet` are also available. Selecting `Parquet` (supported only on Linux, not Windows) exposes a [**Parquet Settings**](#parquet-settings) left tab, where you **must** configure certain options in order to export data in Parquet format.

### Optional Settings

**Staging location**: Local filesystem location in which to buffer files before compressing and moving them to the final destination. Cribl recommends that this location be stable and high-performance. (This field is not displayed or available on Cribl.Cloud-managed Edge Nodes.)

**Partitioning expression**: JavaScript expression that defines how files are partitioned and organized. Default is date-based. If blank, Cribl Edge will fall back to the event's `__partition` field value (if present); or otherwise to the root directory of the **Output Location** and  **Staging Location**.

**Compress**: Data compression format used before moving to final destination. Defaults to `gzip` (recommended). This setting is not available when **Data format** is set to `Parquet`.

**File name prefix expression**: The output filename prefix. Must be a JavaScript expression (which can evaluate to a constant), enclosed in quotes or backticks. Defaults to `CriblOut`.

**File name suffix expression**: The output filename suffix. Must be a JavaScript expression (which can evaluate to a constant), enclosed in quotes or backticks. Defaults to `` `.${C.env["CRIBL_WORKER_ID"]}.${__format}${__compression === "gzip" ? ".gz" : ""}` ``, where `__format` can be `json` or `raw`, and `__compression` can be `none` or `gzip`.

> To prevent files from being overwritten, Cribl appends a random sequence of 6 characters to the end of their names. File name prefix and suffix expressions do not bypass this behavior.
> 
> For example, if you set the **File name prefix expression** to `CriblExec` and set the **File name suffix expression** to `.csv`, the file name might display as `CriblExec-adPRWM.csv` with `adPRWM` appended.
>

**Backpressure Behavior**: Select whether to block or drop events when all receivers are exerting backpressure. (Causes might include an accumulation of too many files needing to be closed.) Defaults to `Block`.

**Tags**: Optionally, add tags that you can use to filter and group Destinations in Cribl Edge's **Manage Destinations** page. These tags aren't added to processed events. Use a tab or hard return between (arbitrary) tag names.

### Processing Settings
 
#### Post‑Processing

**Pipeline**: Pipeline to process data before sending the data out using this output.

**System fields**: A list of fields to automatically add to events that use this output. By default, includes `cribl_pipe` (identifying the Cribl Edge Pipeline that processed the event). Supports wildcards. Other options include:

- `cribl_host` – Cribl Edge Node that processed the event.
- `cribl_input` – Cribl Edge Source that processed the event.
- `cribl_output` – Cribl Edge Destination that processed the event.
- `cribl_route` – Cribl Edge Route (or QuickConnect) that processed the event.
- `cribl_wp` – Cribl Edge Worker Process that processed the event.

### Parquet Settings {#parquet-settings} 

To write out Parquet files, note that:
- Cribl Edge Workers support Parquet only when running on Linux, not on Windows.
- See [Working with Parquet](parquet-schemas) for pointers on how to avoid problems such as data mismatches.

**Parquet schema**: Select a schema from the drop-down. 

> If you need to modify a schema or add a new one, follow the instructions in our [Parquet Schemas](parquet-schemas#creating-parquet-schemas) topic. These steps will propagate the freshest schema back to this drop-down.

**Row group size**: Set the target memory size for row group segments. Modify this value to optimize memory use when writing. Value must be a positive integer smaller than the **File size** value, with appropriate units. Defaults to `16 MB`. 

**Page size**: Set the target memory size for page segments. Generally, set lower values to improve reading speed, or set higher values to improve compression. Value must be a positive integer smaller than the **Row group size** value, with appropriate units. Defaults to `1 MB`.

**Parquet version**: Determines which data types are supported, and how they are represented. Defaults to `2.6`; `2.4` and `1.0` are also available.

**Data page version**: Serialization format for data pages. Defaults to `V1`; `V2` is also available, but not all reader implementations support it.

**Log invalid rows**: Toggle to `Yes` to output up to 20 unique rows that were skipped due to data format mismatch. Log level must be set to `debug` for output to be visible.

### Advanced Settings

**Max file size (MB)**: Maximum uncompressed output file size. Files of this size will be closed and moved to final output location. Defaults to `32`.

**Max file open time (sec)**: Maximum amount of time to write to a file. Files open for longer than this will be closed and moved to final output location. Defaults to `300`. 

**Max file idle time (sec)**: Maximum amount of time to keep inactive files open. Files open for longer than this will be closed and moved to final output location. Defaults to `30`.

**Max open files**: Maximum number of files to keep open concurrently. When exceeded, the oldest open files will be closed and moved to final output location. Defaults to `100`.

> Cribl Edge will close files when **either** of the `Max file size (MB)` or the `Max file open time (sec)` conditions are met.

**Add Output ID**: When set to `Yes` (the default), adds the **Output ID** field's value to the staging location's file path. This ensures that each Destination's logs will write to its own bucket.

> For a Destination originally configured in a Cribl Edge version below 2.4.0, the **Add Output ID** behavior will be switched **off** on the backend, regardless of this slider's state. This is so that upon Cribl Edge upgrade and restart, any files pending in the original staging directory will not be lost. To enable this option for such Destinations, Cribl's recommended migration path is:
> 
> - Clone the Destination.
> - Where Routes reference the original Destination, redirect them to instead reference the new, cloned Destination. 
> 
> This way, the original Destination will process pending files (after an idle timeout), and the new, cloned Destination will process newly arriving events with **Add output ID** enabled.
>

**Remove staging dirs**: Toggle to `Yes` to delete empty staging directories after moving files. This prevents the proliferation of orphaned empty directories. When enabled, exposes this additional option:
  - **Staging cleanup period**: How often (in seconds) to delete empty directories when **Remove staging dirs** is enabled. Defaults to `300` seconds (every 5 minutes). Minimum configurable interval is `10` seconds; maximum is `86400` seconds (every 24 hours).



**Environment**: If you're using GitOps, optionally use this field to specify a single Git branch on which to enable this configuration. If empty, the config will be enabled everywhere.

## Internal Fields

Cribl Edge uses a set of internal fields to assist in forwarding data to a Destination. 

Field for this Destination:

* `__partition`

> To export events from an intermediate stage **within a Pipeline** to a file, see the [Tee Function](tee-function).
