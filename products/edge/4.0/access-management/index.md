# Access Management


Cribl Edge provides a range of access-management features for users with different security requirements. For details, see the following topics:

- [Authentication](authentication): Authenticating users in Cribl Edge.
- [Local Users](local-users): Creating and managing users and their permissions.
- [Roles](roles): Managing roles and policies to assign to users.

> Role-based access control can be enabled only on distributed deployments ([Stream](/stream/deploy-distributed), [Edge](/edge/setting-up-leader-and-edge-nodes)) with an [Enterprise license](licensing). With other license types and/or single-instance deployments ([Stream](/stream/deploy-single-instance), [Edge](/edge/deploy-single-instance)), all users will have full administrative privileges.
