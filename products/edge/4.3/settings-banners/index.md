# Custom Banners


In version 4.3 and later, Cribl admins can define a custom banner from the Leader. This will be displayed at the top of your Cribl Organization's UI, above all Cribl apps. You can display one banner at a time. 

Your banner can display warnings, requirements, neutral updates, or good news about new features or options. It can contain a mixture of text, a raw URL, or a URL with a friendly/short label. The banner does not appear unless you enable and configure it, as outlined below.

1. From Cribl Edge's top nav, select **Settings** > **Global Settings**.
1. From the resulting left nav, select **System** > **Custom Banner**.
1. Toggle the **Enable banner** slider on. This exposes the configuration options below.
1. From the **Color theme** drop-down, select a background color matching your banner's severity. (Cribl reserves dark red, light blue, and light green for system notifications, so the drop-down offers alternative shades of these colors.)
1. In the **Banner message** field, enter a single-line message of up to 1,024 characters. (The displayed banner will truncate characters that cannot fit across one line of a given viewport.)
1. In the **Link URL** field, optionally enter a hyperlink to append to the message.
1. In the **Link display** field, optionally give your **Link URL** a text label. This can include up to 512 characters, but a long label can force-truncate the **Banner message**. A short label can help everything fit. 
1. Click **Save** to display your banner.
1. Commit your changes from the Leader.

To hide the banner, toggle the **Enable banner** slider off, and again **Save** and commit your changes. Your banner's configuration will remain intact, ready to re-enable and/or revise when you're ready.
