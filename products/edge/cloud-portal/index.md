# Manage Cribl.Cloud Organization


The Cribl.Cloud portal is the place where you get an overview of and manage your organization,
configure network settings, and control user access and billing information.

## Switch Organizations

When you own or are a Member of multiple Cribl.Cloud Organizations,
you can switch between the Organizations:

1. In the top bar, hover over the name of your Organization.
1. In the drop-down, select the Organization you want to switch to.

Alternatively, in the drop-down you can select **Manage Organizations**.
You will move to an Organization landing page, displayed to an Organization's Owners and Admins,
where you can view details of all your Organizations,
switch to any of them, add a new one or delete one, if you have proper permissions.

## Configure Organization Details

To customize your Organization information, in the sidebar, select **Organization**.

You can modify the following information:

|Field name|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|**Organization Name** |A "friendly" name for your Organization. Upon signing in, Members will see this alias above the Organization ID on the Select Organization page.|
|**Description**|Add further details about your Organization.|
|**Opt in to beta features**| If displayed, this check box enables access to new options that Cribl has not yet made generally available. As with all beta features, expect some instability in exchange for advancing to the cutting edge of your Cribl.Cloud.|

Select **Save** to immediately apply your changes.

You can check additional information about your Organization,
including the AWS [Cloud region](/stream/cloud-workers#providers) in which it's located, the software version, and license,
by selecting **Organization Details** at the bottom of the sidebar.

## Ingress Ports {#ports}

Your Cribl.Cloud Organization's preconfigured and user-configurable ports for inbound data are set at the Workspace level. For details, see [Cribl.Cloud Ports](/stream/ports#cloud-ports).

## Get Support

In the top bar, select the ![Support icon](support-icon.svg) **Support** icon to access a set of links with additional resources about Cribl Edge, including:

- Sandboxes (free, interactive tutorials on fully hosted integrations)
- Cribl University
- Concept/demo videos

Refer to [Cribl Status](https://status.cribl.cloud/) for information about Cribl.Cloud availability,
including current and historical uptime data, and incidents, split by component and AWS Region.

You can also subscribe there to incident notifications via email, text, Slack, or RSS.

## Manage Personal Settings

Use the **Account** menu in the top right of the Cribl.Cloud portal to configure your personal settings.

Select **My profile** to update your personal information.
Here, you can also reset the configured biometric authentication.
Do this, if you want to re-configure the authentication,
or if you don't want to be prompted to log in through fingerprint or face recognition.
