# Amazon MSK Destination


Cribl Edge supports sending data to an Amazon [Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka](https://aws.amazon.com/msk/) (MSK) topic.

> Type: Streaming | TLS Support: Configurable | PQ Support: Yes 
> 
> Kafka uses a binary protocol over TCP. It does not support HTTP proxies, so Cribl Edge must send events directly to receivers. You might need to adjust your firewall rules to allow this traffic.
>

## Configuring Cribl Edge to Output to Kafka

From the top nav, click **Manage**, then select a **Fleet** to configure. Next, you have two options:

To configure via the graphical [QuickConnect](quickconnect) UI, click Routing > QuickConnect (Stream) or Collect (Edge). Next, click **Add Destination** at right. From the resulting drawer's tiles, select **Amazon MSK**. Next, click either **Add Destination** or (if displayed) **Select Existing**. The resulting drawer will provide the options below.

 
Or, to configure via the [Routing](routes) UI, click **Data** > **Destinations** (Stream) or **More** > **Destinations** (Edge). From the resulting page's tiles or the **Destinations** left nav, select **Amazon MSK**. Next, click **Add Destination** to open a **New Destination** modal that provides the options below.

### General Settings

**Output ID**: Enter a unique name to identify this Amazon MSK Destination definition. If you clone this Destination, Cribl Edge will add `-CLONE` to the original **Output ID**.

**Bootstrap servers**: List of Kafka bootstrap servers to connect to (for example, `localhost:9092`).

**Topic**: The topic on which to publish events. Can be overwritten using the event's `__topicOut` field.

**Region**: From the drop-down, select the name of the [AWS Region](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/) where your Amazon MSK cluster is located.

### Optional Settings

**Acknowledgments**:  Select the number of required acknowledgments. Defaults to `Leader`.

**Record data format**: Format to use to serialize events before writing to Kafka. Defaults to `JSON`. When set to `Protobuf`, the [**Protobuf Format Settings**](#protobuf-settings) section (left tab) becomes available.

**Compression**: Codec to compress the data before sending to Kafka. Select `None`, `Gzip`, `Snappy`, or `LZ4`. Defaults to `Gzip`.

> Cribl strongly recommends enabling compression. Doing so improves Cribl Edge's performance, enabling faster data transfer using less bandwidth.
>
{.box .info}

**Backpressure behavior**: Select whether to block, drop, or queue incoming events when all receivers are exerting backpressure. Defaults to `Block`. 

**Tags**: Optionally, add tags that you can use to filter and group Destinations in Cribl Edge's **Manage Destinations** page. These tags aren't added to processed events. Use a tab or hard return between (arbitrary) tag names.

### Persistent Queue Settings

> This tab is displayed when the **Backpressure behavior** is set to **Persistent Queue**. 
>
{.box .info}

> On Cribl-managed [Cribl.Cloud](deploy-cloud) Workers (with an [Enterprise plan](cloud-enterprise)), this tab exposes only the destructive **Clear Persistent Queue** button (described below in this section). A maximum queue size of 1 GB disk space is automatically allocated per PQ‑enabled Destination, per Worker Process. The 1 GB limit is on outbound uncompressed data, and no compression is applied to the queue. 
> 
> This limit is not configurable. If the queue fills up, Cribl Edge will block outbound data. To configure the queue size, compression, queue-full fallback behavior, and other options below, use a [hybrid Group](cloud-enterprise#hybrid).
>
{.box .cloud}

**Max file size**: The maximum data volume to store in each queue file before closing it. Enter a numeral and a unit designation such as `KB` or `MB`. Defaults to `1 MB`. Defaults to `1 MB`.

**Max queue size**: The maximum amount of disk space the queue is allowed to consume. Once this limit is reached, queueing is stopped and data blocking is applied. Enter a numeral and a unit designation such as `KB` or `MB`.

**Queue file path**: The location for the persistent queue files. This will be of the form: `your/path/here/<worker‑id>/<output‑id>`. Defaults to: `$CRIBL_HOME/state/queues`.

**Compression**: Codec to use to compress the persisted data, once a file is closed. Defaults to `None`; `Gzip` is also available.

**Queue-full behavior**: Whether to block or drop events when the queue is exerting backpressure (because disk is low or at full capacity). **Block** is the same behavior as non-PQ blocking, corresponding to the **Block** option on the **Backpressure behavior** drop-down. **Drop new data** throws away incoming data, while leaving the contents of the PQ unchanged.

**Strict ordering**: The default `Yes` position enables FIFO (first in, first out) event forwarding. When receivers recover, Cribl Edge will send earlier queued events before forwarding newly arrived events. To instead prioritize new events before draining the queue, toggle this off. Doing so will expose this additional control:
- **Drain rate limit (EPS)**: Optionally, set a throttling rate (in events per second) on writing from the queue to receivers. (The default `0` value disables throttling.) Throttling the queue's drain rate can boost the throughput of new/active connections, by reserving more resources for them. You can further optimize Workers' startup connections and CPU load at **Fleet Settings** > [Worker Processes](settings-group-fleet#processes).

**Clear Persistent Queue**: Click this "panic" button if you want to delete the files that are currently queued for delivery to this Destination. A confirmation modal will appear - because this will free up disk space by permanently deleting the queued data, without delivering it to downstream receivers. (Appears only after **Output ID** has been defined.)

#### Calculating the Time PQ Will Take to Engage

PQ will not engage until Cribl Edge has exhausted all attempts to send events to the Kafka receiver. This can take several minutes if requests continue to fail or time out. 

To calculate the longest possible time this can take, multiply the values of **Request timeout** and **Max retries**. For the default values (`60` seconds and `5`, respectively), this would be `60` seconds times `5` retries = 300 seconds, or 5 minutes.

### TLS Settings (Client Side) {#tls_client}

> For Amazon MSK Sources and Destinations:
> * IAM is the only type of authentication that Cribl Edge supports. 
> * Because IAM auth requires TLS, TLS is automatically enabled.
>
{.box .info}

* **Validate server certs**: Require client to reject any connection that is not authorized by a CA in the **CA certificate path**, or by another trusted CA (such as the system's CA). Defaults to `Yes`.

**Server name (SNI)**: Leave this field blank. See [Connecting to Kafka](#connecting) below.

**Certificate name**: The name of the predefined certificate.
 
**CA certificate path**: Path on client containing CA certificates (in PEM format) to use to verify the server's cert. Path can reference `$ENV_VARS`.
 
**Private key path (mutual auth)**: Path on client containing the private key (in PEM format) to use.  Path can reference `$ENV_VARS`. **Use only if mutual auth is required**.
 
**Certificate path (mutual auth)**: Path on client containing certificates in (PEM format) to use. Path can reference `$ENV_VARS`. **Use only if mutual auth is required**. 
 
**Passphrase**: Passphrase to use to decrypt private key.

**Minimum TLS version**: Optionally, select the minimum TLS version to use when connecting.

**Maximum TLS version**: Optionally, select the maximum TLS version to use when connecting.

### Authentication



Use the **Authentication method** drop-down to select an AWS authentication method.

**Auto**: This default option uses the AWS instance's metadata service to automatically obtain short-lived credentials from the IAM role attached to an EC2 instance, local credentials, sidecar, or other source. The attached IAM role grants Cribl Edge Workers access to authorized AWS resources. Can also use the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. Works only when running on AWS.

**Manual**: If not running on AWS, you can select this option to enter a static set of user-associated IAM credentials (your access key and secret key) directly or by reference. This is useful for Workers not in an AWS VPC, such as those running in a private cloud. The **Manual** option exposes these corresponding additional fields:

- **Access key**: Enter your AWS access key. If not present, will fall back to the `env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` environment variable, or to the metadata endpoint for IAM role credentials.

- **Secret key**: Enter your AWS secret key. If not present, will fall back to the `env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable, or to the metadata endpoint for IAM credentials.

**Secret**: If not running on AWS, you can select this option to supply a stored secret that references an AWS access key and secret key. The **Secret** option exposes this additional field:

- **Secret key pair**: Use the drop-down to select an API key/secret key pair that you've [configured](securing-and-monitoring#secrets) in Cribl Edge's secrets manager. A **Create** link is available to store a new, reusable secret.

### Assume Role

When using Assume Role to access resources in a different region than Cribl Stream, you can target the [AWS Security Token Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html) (STS) endpoint specific to that region by using the `CRIBL_AWS_STS_REGION` environment variable on your Edge Node. Setting an invalid region results in a fallback to the global STS endpoint.

**Enable for MSK**: Toggle on to use Assume Role credentials to access MSK. 

**AssumeRole ARN**: Enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role to assume.

**External ID**: Enter the External ID to use when assuming role. This is required only when assuming a role that requires this ID in order to delegate third-party access. For details, see [AWS' documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html).



**Duration (seconds)**: Duration of the Assumed Role's session, in seconds. Minimum is 900 (15 minutes). Maximum is 43200 (12 hours). Defaults to 3600 (1 hour).

### Processing Settings

#### Post‑Processing

**Pipeline**: Pipeline to process data before sending the data out using this output.

**System fields**: A list of fields to automatically add to events that use this output. By default, includes `cribl_pipe` (identifying the Cribl Edge Pipeline that processed the event). Supports wildcards. Other options include:

- `cribl_host` – Cribl Edge Node that processed the event.
- `cribl_input` – Cribl Edge Source that processed the event.
- `cribl_output` – Cribl Edge Destination that processed the event.
- `cribl_route` – Cribl Edge Route (or QuickConnect) that processed the event.
- `cribl_wp` – Cribl Edge Worker Process that processed the event.

### Retries

These settings provide flexibility in handling retries for failed messages, allowing you to balance between quick retries and avoiding excessive load on the system.

The default configuration starts with a 300 milliseconds retry interval, doubles the interval after each retry, and caps the maximum retry interval at 30 seconds. The system will attempt to retry the request up to five times before considering it a failure.

**Max retries**: Maximum number of times to retry a failed request before the message fails. Defaults to `5`. Enter `0` to not retry at all. For example, if set to `5`, the system will attempt to retry the request up to five times before considering it a failure.

**Initial retry interval (ms)**: Initial value used to calculate the retry interval, in milliseconds. This value determines the starting point for the retry delay. The default (and minimum) is `300` ms (three seconds). The maximum allowed value is `600000` ms (10 minutes). For example, if set to `1000` ms, the first retry will occur after one second.

**Backoff multiplier**: Set the backoff multiplier (`2-20`) to control the retry frequency for failed messages. The multiplier is used in an exponential backoff formula to increase the delay between retries. For faster retries, use a lower multiplier. For slower retries with more delay between attempts, use a higher multiplier. For example, with an initial retry interval of `1000` ms and a multiplier of `2`, the retry intervals will be 1,000 ms, 2,000 ms, 4,000 ms, and so on. See the Kafka [documentation](https://kafka.js.org/docs/retry-detailed) for details.

**Backoff limit (ms)**: The maximum wait time for a retry, in milliseconds. This setting caps the exponential backoff delay to prevent excessively long wait times. The default (and minimum) value is `30000` ms (30 seconds), and the maximum is `180000` ms (180 seconds). For example, if the calculated retry interval exceeds 180,000 ms, the retry will occur after 180,000 ms instead.

### Advanced Settings

**Max record size (KB, uncompressed)**: Maximum size (KB) of each record batch before compression. Setting should be < `message.max.bytes settings` in Kafka brokers. Defaults to `768`.

**Max events per batch**: Maximum number of events in a batch before forcing a flush. Defaults to `1000`.

**Flush period (sec)**: Maximum time between requests. Low values could cause the payload size to be smaller than its configured maximum. Defaults to `1`.

**Connection timeout (ms)**: Maximum time to wait for a connection to complete successfully. Defaults to `10000` ms (10 seconds). Valid range is `1000` to `3600000` ms (1 second to 1 hour).

**Request timeout (ms)**: Maximum time to wait for Kafka to respond to a request. Defaults to `60000` ms (1 minute).

**Authentication timeout (ms)**: Maximum time to wait for Kafka to respond to an authentication request. Defaults to `1000` (1 second).

**Reauthentication threshold (ms)**: If the broker requires periodic reauthentication, this setting defines how long before the reauthentication timeout Cribl Edge initiates the reauthentication. Defaults to `10000` (10 seconds).

A small value for this setting, combined with high network latency, might prevent the Destination from reauthenticating before the Kafka broker closes the connection.

A large value might cause the Destination to send reauthentication messages too soon, wasting bandwidth.

The Kafka setting `connections.max.reauth.ms` controls the reuthentication threshold on the Kafka side.

**Environment**: If you're using GitOps, optionally use this field to specify a single Git branch on which to enable this configuration. If empty, the config will be enabled everywhere.

### Protobuf Format Settings {#protobuf-settings}

**Definition set**: From the drop-down, select `OpenTelemetry`. This makes the **Object type** setting available.   

**Object type**: From the drop-down, select `Logs`, `Metrics`, or `Traces`.

#### Working with Protobufs

This Destination supports supports Binary Protobuf payload encoding. The Protobufs it sends can encode traces, metrics, or logs, the three types of telemetry data defined in the OpenTelemetry Project's [Data Sources](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/data-sources/) documentation:

- A **trace** tracks the progression of a single request. 
    - Each trace is a tree of **spans**.
    - A span object represents the work being done by the individual services, or components, involved in a request as that request flows through a system.
- A **metric** provides aggreggated statistical information. 
    - A metric contains individual measurements called **data points**.
- A **log**, in OpenTelemetry terms, is "any data that is not part of a distributed trace or a metric".

When configuring Pipelines (including pre-processing and post-processing Pipelines), you need to ensure that events sent to this Destination conform to the relevant Protobuf specification:

- For traces, [opentelemetry/proto/trace/v1/trace.proto](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/v0.9.0/opentelemetry/proto/trace/v1/trace.proto).
- For metrics, [opentelemetry/proto/metrics/v1/metrics.proto](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/v0.9.0/opentelemetry/proto/metrics/v1/metrics.proto).
- For logs, [opentelemetry/proto/logs/v1/logs.proto](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/tree/v0.9.0/opentelemetry/proto/logs/v1).

This Destination will drop non-conforming events. If the Destination encounters a parsing error when trying to convert an event to OTLP, it discards the event and Cribl Edge logs the error.

## Connecting to Kafka {#connecting} 

> ##### Leave the **TLS Settings** > **Server name (SNI)** field blank
>
> In Cribl Edge's Kafka-based Sources and Destinations (including this one), the Kafka library that Cribl Edge uses manages SNI (Server Name Indication) without any input from Cribl Edge. Therefore, you should leave the **TLS Settings** > **Server name (SNI)** field blank.
> 
> Setting this field in the Cribl Edge UI can cause traffic to be routed to the wrong brokers, because it interferes with the Kafka library's operation.

{.box .warning}

Connecting to a Kafka cluster involves using hostnames for two key components: bootstrap servers and brokers.

Brokers are servers that comprise the storage layer in a Kafka cluster. Bootstrap servers handle the initial connection to the Kafka cluster, and then return the list of brokers. A broker list can run into the hundreds. Every Kafka cluster has a `bootstrap.servers` [property](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/iis/11.7?topic=kafka-setting-up-server), defined as either a single `hostname:port` K-V pair, or a list of them. If Cribl Edge tries to connect via one bootstrap server and that fails, Cribl Edge then tries another one on the list.

In the **General Settings** > **Bootstrap servers** list, you can enter either the hostnames of brokers that your Kafka server has been configured to use, or, the hostnames of one or more bootstrap servers. If Kafka returns a list of brokers that's longer than the list you entered, Cribl Edge keeps the full list internally. Cribl Edge neither saves the list nor makes it available in the UI. The connection process simply starts at the beginning whenever the Source or Destination is started.

Here's an overview of the connection process:

1. From the **General Settings** > **Bootstrap servers** list – where each broker is listed as a hostname and port – Cribl Edge takes a hostname and resolves it to an IP address.

2. Cribl Edge makes a connection to that IP address. Notwithstanding the fact that Cribl Edge resolved **one** particular hostname to that IP address, there may be **many** services running at that IP address – each with its own distinct hostname.

3. Cribl Edge establishes TLS security for the connection.

Although SNI is managed by the Kafka library rather than in the Cribl Edge UI, you might want to know how it fits into the connection process. The purpose of the SNI is to specify one hostname – that is, service – among many that might be running on a given IP address within a Kafka cluster. Excluding the other services is one way that TLS makes the connection more secure.

## Working with Event Timestamps {#timestamps}

By default, when an incoming event reaches this Destination, the underlying Kafka JS library adds a `timestamp` field set to the current time at that moment. The library gets the current time from the `Date.now()` JavaScript method. Events that this Destination sends to downstream Kafka receivers include this `timestamp` field.

Some production situations require the `timestamp` value to be the time an incoming event was originally created by an upstream sender, not the current time of its arrival at this Destination. For example, suppose the events were originally created over a wide time range, and arrive at the Destination hours or days later. In this case, the original creation time might be important to retain in events Cribl Edge sends to downstream Kafka receivers.  

Here is how to satisfy such a requirement:

1. In a Pipeline that routes events to this Destination, use an Eval Function to add a field named `__kafkaTime` and write the incoming event's original creation time into that field. The value of `__kafkaTime` **must** be in UNIX epoch time ([either seconds or milliseconds since the UNIX epoch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Unix_time) – both will work). For context, see [this explanation](/stream/sources-msk#how-criblstream-handles-the-_time-field) of the related fields `_time` and `__origTime`.
2. This Destination will recognize the `__kafkaTime` field and write its value into the `timestamp` field. (This is similar to the way you can use the `__topicOut` field to overwrite a topic setting, as described [above](#general-settings).)

If the `__kafkaTime` field is **not** present, the Destination will apply the default behavior (using `Date.now()`) described previously.

## Internal Fields

Cribl Edge uses a set of internal fields to assist in forwarding data to a Destination. 

Fields for this Destination:

  * `__topicOut`
  * `__key`
  * `__headers`
  * `__keySchemaIdOut`
  * `__valueSchemaIdOut`
