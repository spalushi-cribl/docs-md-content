# Linux System Metrics Details


Events generated by the [System Metrics](sources-system-metrics) Source have metrics metadata to designate dimension and metric fields. The `host` field contains the hostname, and is included as a dimension in all of them. The collectors include:

- [System](#system)
- [CPU](#cpu)
- [Memory](#memory)
- [Network](#network)
- [Disk](#disk)
- [Container](#container)
- [Process](#process-metrics)

In the Source's configuration modal, you can set the level of detail for each type of metrics:

- **Basic** enables minimal metrics, averaged or aggregated.
- **All** enables full, detailed metrics, specified for individual CPUs, interfaces, and so on.
- **Custom** displays sub-menus and buttons from which you can choose a level of detail (Basic, All, Custom, or Disabled) for each type of event.
- **Disabled** means that no metrics will be generated.

**Basic** and **Custom** have different meanings depending on event type and will be described under each section below. 

The tables outline the metrics emitted for each mode (Basic or Custom) and where applicable, the dimensions (to indicate where the metrics are coming from).

## Process Metrics

With Process Metrics enabled, Cribl Edge captures process-specific metrics from
Linux servers and reports them as events. This allows you to monitor specific
processes on Cribl.Cloud instances. You can generate events for any process object.

For information on how to configure the System Metrics Source to generate
process-specific metrics, check out the Process Metrics
section of the [System Metrics](sources-system-metrics#process-metrics) page.

Process-specific metrics are **not** affected by the **Host Metrics** detail
setting.
