# Members and Teams


One of the main benefits of Workspaces is the ability to granularly control which users have access to which parts of the system. Access management is done though assigning permissions to individual Members and Teams within a Workspace.

If a Member has overlapping assigned permissions, the highest permission is given.

### Members

When inviting a new user to your Organization, configure permissions for Workspaces
in the **Workspace Access** section.

- Select a Member permission in the **Permission** dropdown next to the Workspace.
  
  When you choose the **Member** permission, configure [access for each Cribl product](members#permissions-product) separately:



- Alternatively, select the check box next to one or more Workspaces
  and choose a permission under **Set bulk permission**.
  This permission will then be granted to the user for all selected Workspaces.



### Teams

Teams are groups of Members who share the same Workspace and product-level permissions. This allows you to efficiently manage access control by assigning permissions to the Team rather than configuring each Member individually.

To configure a Team:

1. On the left-side menu, expand **Organization** and then select **Teams**.
1. Select **Create Team** and the configuration modal is displayed.
1. Provide a meaningful **Name** and optionally a **Description**.
1. Select the desired Workspace and access to assign to the Team. **Members** allow granular [product-level](/stream/members#permissions-product) permissions. 
1. In **Team Members**, select the Members you want to add, then **Add** them. A Member must already exist to be added to a Team.
1. The table is updated to show the Members you've just added.
1. When finished, **Save** your new Team.

The main Teams page displays the Teams configured on your Workspace. You can **Edit** or delete them as needed from the **Actions** column.
