# Datadog Destination


Cribl Edge can send log and metric events to [Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/). Datadog supports metrics of type `gauge`, `counter`, `rate`, and `distribution` via its REST API.

Cribl Edge sends data via two primary Datadog endpoints, which must be accessible from your Cribl environment:
- Logs: Data is routed through `http-intake.logs.{domain}`
- Metrics: Data is sent via `api.{domain}`

The `{domain}` placeholder in the endpoints represents the specific Datadog region you're using. By default, this is set to `datadoghq.com` for the `US` region. You can configure an alternative region with the **Datadog site** under **Optional Settings** below.

Supported Domains:
- US: `datadoghq.com` (default)
- US3: `us3.datadoghq.com`
- US5: `us5.datadoghq.com`
- Europe: `datadoghq.eu`
- US1-FED: `ddog-gov.com`
- AP1: `ap1.datadoghq.com`
- Custom: `custom.datadoghq.com`

> Type: Streaming | TLS Support: Yes | PQ Support: Yes

## Configure Cribl Edge to Output to Datadog

1. On the top bar, select **Products**, and then select **Cribl Edge**. Under **Fleets**, select a Fleet. Next, you have two options:
   - To configure via [QuickConnect](quickconnect), navigate to **Routing** > **QuickConnect** (Stream) or **Collect** (Edge). Select **Add Destination** and select the Destination you want from the list, choosing either **Select Existing** or **Add New**. 
   - To configure via the [Routes](routes), select **Data** > **Destinations** or **More** > **Destinations** (Edge). Select the Destination you want. Next, select **Add Destination**.
2. In the **New Destination** modal, configure the following under **General Settings**:
   - **Output ID**: Enter a unique name to identify this Destination definition. 
   - **Description**: Optionally, enter a description.
3. Under **Authentication**, select an **Authentication method** from the dropdown:
   - **Manual**: Displays a field for you to enter an **API key** that is available in your Datadog profile.
   - **Secret**: This option exposes an **API key (text secret)** drop-down, in which you can select a [stored secret](/stream/securing-secrets/) that references the API access token described above. A **Create** link is available to store a new, reusable secret.
   - **API key**: Enter your Datadog organization's API key.
4. Next, you can configure the following **Optional Settings**: 
     - **Datadog site**: Select the [Datadog region](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/site/#access-the-datadog-site) you are sending to. Defaults to `US`; the other options are `US3`, `US5`, `Europe`, `US1-FED`, `AP1`, and `Custom`. Select `Custom` to manually enter your Datadog region’s URL if it’s not listed.
     - **Send logs as**: Specify the content type to use when sending logs. Defaults to `application/json`, where each log message is represented by a JSON object. The alternative `text/plain` option sends one message per line, with newline `\n` delimiters.
     - **Message field**: Name of the event field that contains the message to send. If not specified, Cribl Edge sends a JSON representation of the whole event (regardless of whether **Send logs as** is set to JSON or plain text).
     - **Source**: Name of the source to send with logs. If you're sending logs as JSON objects (that is, you've selected **Send logs as**: `application/json`), the event's `source` field (if set) will override this value.
     - **Host**: Name of the host to send with logs. If you're sending logs as JSON objects, the event's `host` field (if set) will override this value.
     - **Service**: Name of the service to send with logs. If you're sending logs as JSON objects, the event's `__service` field (if set) will override this value.
     - **Datadog tags**: List of tags to send with logs, such as `env:prod`, `env_staging:east`. These tags enhance search and filtering in Datadog. For log events, these tags are used in the default batching behavior controlled by the **Batch by tags** advanced setting. High tag cardinality can affect performance.
     - **Severity**: Default value for message severity. If you're sending logs as JSON objects, the event's `__severity` field (if set) will override this value.

      > Datadog uses the above five fields (`source`, `host`, `__service`, `tags`, and `__severity`) to enhance searches.
      >
      {.box .info}

      - **Allow API key from events**: If toggled on, any API key in the `__agent_api_key` internal field will override the **API key** field's value. This option is useful if events originate from multiple Datadog Agent Sources, each configured with a different API key. (For further details, see [Managing API Keys](sources-datadog-agent#api-keys-datadog).)

      - **Backpressure behavior**: Specify whether to block, drop, or queue events when all receivers are exerting backpressure. Defaults to `Block`.

      - **Tags**: Optionally, add tags that you can use to filter and group Destinations on the **Destinations** page. These tags aren't added to processed events. Use a tab or hard return between (arbitrary) tag names.
5. Optionally, you can adjust the [Persistent Queue](#pq), [Processing](#processing), [Retries](#retries), and [Advanced](#advanced-tab) settings outlined in the sections below.
6. Select **Save**, then **Commit & Deploy**.


### Persistent Queue Settings {#pq}

The **Persistent Queue Settings** tab displays when the **Backpressure behavior** option in **General settings** is set to **Persistent Queue**. Persistent queue buffers and preserves incoming events when a downstream Destination has an outage or experiences backpressure.

Before enabling persistent queue, learn more about persistent queue behavior and how to optimize it with
your system:

- [About Persistent Queues](/persistent-queues)
- [Optimize Destination Persistent Queues (dPQ)](/persistent-queues-destinations)
- [Destination Backpressure Triggers](/destinations-backpressure-triggers)

> On Cribl-managed [Cloud](deploy-cloud) Workers (with an [Enterprise plan](cloud-enterprise)), this tab exposes only the destructive **Clear Persistent Queue** button (described at the end of this section). A maximum queue size of 1 GB disk space is automatically allocated per PQ‑enabled Destination, per Worker Process. The 1 GB limit is on outbound uncompressed data, and no compression is applied to the queue.
>
> This limit is not configurable. If the queue fills up, Cribl Stream/Edge will block outbound data. To configure the queue size, compression, queue-full fallback behavior, and other options below, use a [hybrid Group](cloud-enterprise#hybrid).
>
{.box .cloud}

**Mode:** Use this menu to select when Cribl Stream/Edge engages the persistent queue in response to backpressure events from this Destination. The options are:

   | Mode | Description |
   | ---- | ----------- |
   | **Error** | Queues and stores data on a disk when the Destination is unavailable or in an error state. |
   | **Backpressure** | Queues and stores data to a disk when it detects backpressure from the Destination until the backpressure event resolves. |
   | **Always On** | Cribl Stream or Edge immediately queues and stores all data on a disk for all events, even when there is no backpressure. |

> If a Worker/Edge Node starts with an invalid **Mode** setting, it automatically switches to **Error** mode.
> This might happen if the Worker/Edge Node is running a version that does not support other modes (older than 4.9.0),
> or if it encounters a nonexistent value in YAML configuration files.
{.box .warning}

**File size limit**: The maximum data volume to store in each queue file before closing it. Enter a numeral with units of KB, MB, etc. Defaults to `1 MB`.

**Queue size limit**: The maximum amount of disk space that the queue can consume on each Worker Process. When the queue reaches this limit, the Destination stops queueing data and applies the **Queue‑full** behavior. Defaults to `5` GB. This field accepts positive numbers with units of `KB`, `MB`, `GB`, and so on. You can set it as high as `1 TB`, unless you've [configured](group-settings#storage) a different **Worker Process PQ size limit** on the Worker Group/Fleet Settings page.

**Queue file path**: The location for the persistent queue files. Defaults to `$CRIBL_HOME/state/queues`. Cribl Stream/Edge will append `/<worker‑id>/<output‑id>` to this value.

**Compression**: Set the codec to use when compressing the persisted data after closing a file. Defaults to `None`. `Gzip` is also available.

**Queue-full behavior**: Whether to block or drop events when the queue begins to exert backpressure. A queue begins to exert backpressure when the disk is low or at full capacity. This setting has two options:

  - **Block**: The output will refuse to accept new data until the receiver is ready. The system will return block signals back to the sender.
  - **Drop new data**: Discard all new events until the backpressure event has resolved and the receiver is ready.

**Backpressure duration Limit**: When **Mode** is set to `Backpressure`, this setting controls how long to wait during network slowdowns before activating queues. A shorter duration enhances critical data loss prevention, while a longer duration helps avoid unnecessary queue transitions in environments with frequent, brief network fluctuations. The default value is `30` seconds.

**Strict ordering**: Toggle on (default) to enable FIFO (first in, first out) event forwarding, ensuring Cribl Stream/Edge sends earlier queued events first when receivers recover. The persistent queue flushes every 10 seconds in this mode. Toggle off to prioritize new events over queued events, configure a custom drain rate for the queue, and display this option:

  - **Drain rate limit (EPS)**: Optionally, set a throttling rate (in events per second) on writing from the queue to receivers. (The default `0` value disables throttling.) Throttling the queue drain rate can boost the throughput of new and active connections by reserving more resources for them. You can further optimize Worker startup connections and CPU load in the [Worker Processes](group-settings#processes) settings.

**Clear Persistent Queue**: For Cloud Enterprise only, click this button if you want to delete the files that are currently queued for delivery to this Destination. If you click this button, a confirmation modal appears. Clearing the queue frees up disk space by permanently deleting the queued data, without delivering it to downstream receivers. This button only appears after you define the **Output ID**.

> Use the **Clear Persistent Queue** button with caution to avoid data loss. See [Steps to Safely Disable and Clear Persistent Queues](/persistent-queues-destinations#clear-pq) for more information.

### Processing Settings {#processing}

#### Post‑Processing

**Pipeline**: [Pipeline](pipelines) or [Pack](packs) to process data before sending the data out using this output.

**System fields**: A list of fields to automatically add to events that use this output. By default, includes `cribl_pipe` (identifying the Cribl Edge Pipeline that processed the event). Supports wildcards. Other options include:

- `cribl_host` – Cribl Edge Node that processed the event.
- `cribl_input` – Cribl Edge Source that processed the event.
- `cribl_output` – Cribl Edge Destination that processed the event.
- `cribl_route` – Cribl Edge Route (or QuickConnect) that processed the event.
- `cribl_wp` – Cribl Edge Worker Process that processed the event.

### Retries {#retries}

**Honor Retry-After header**: Toggle on to honor a [`Retry-After` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Retry-After), provided that the header specifies a delay no longer than 180 seconds. Cribl Stream/Edge limits the delay to 180 seconds even if the `Retry-After` header specifies a longer delay. Any `Retry-After` header received takes precedence over all other options configured in the **Retries** section. Toggle off to ignore all `Retry-After` headers.

**Settings for failed HTTP requests**: When you want to automatically retry requests that receive particular HTTP response status codes, use these settings to list those response codes. 

For any HTTP response status codes that are not explicitly configured for retries, Cribl Stream/Edge applies the following rules:

| Status Code | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Any in the `1xx`, `3xx`, or `4xx` series | Drop the request |
| Any in the `5xx` series                  | Retry the request |

Upon receiving a response code that's on the list, Cribl Stream/Edge first waits for a set time interval called the **Pre-backoff interval** and then begins retrying the request. Time between retries increases based on an [exponential backoff algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff) whose base is the **Backoff multiplier**, until the backoff multiplier reaches the **Backoff limit (ms)**. At that point, Cribl Stream/Edge continues retrying the request without increasing the time between retries any further.

If the sender (which manages the connection to the Destination) is at capacity, it will not accept any incoming events. These incoming events originate internally from a previous stage of the data flow when Destinations send outbound requests to their respective external services, and they include retry requests and new requests. Any events that were already in transit when the sender reached capacity will continue to be processed downstream.

Sender capacity is freed up when an outgoing request succeeds or encounters a non-retryable error. When the sender has available capacity again, it will resume accepting incoming events. This capacity management is influenced by the number of active connections and configured limits, such as concurrency and buffer sizes. If a Pipeline sends events faster than the Destination can process, the buffers may fill up, leading to backpressure and `Sender at capacity` warnings. This backpressure prevents the sender from accepting additional requests until capacity is restored.

By default, this Destination has no response codes configured for automatic retries. For each response code you want to add to the list, select **Add Setting** and configure the following settings: 

- **HTTP status code**: A response code that indicates a failed request, for example `429 (Too Many Requests)` or `503 (Service Unavailable)`.
- **Pre-backoff interval (ms)**: The amount of time to wait before beginning retries, in milliseconds. Defaults to `1000` (one second).
- **Backoff multiplier**: The base for the exponential backoff algorithm. A value of `2` (the default) means that Cribl Stream/Edge will retry after 2 seconds, then 4 seconds, then 8 seconds, and so on.
- **Backoff limit (ms)**: The maximum backoff interval Cribl Stream/Edge should apply for its final retry, in milliseconds. Default (and minimum) is `10,000` (10 seconds); maximum is `180,000` (180 seconds, or 3 minutes).

**Retry timed-out HTTP requests**: Toggle on to automatically retry requests that have timed out and display the following settings for configuring retry behavior:

- **Pre-backoff interval (ms)**: The amount of time to wait before beginning retries, in milliseconds. Defaults to `1000` (one second).
- **Backoff multiplier**: The base for the exponential backoff algorithm. A value of `2` (the default) means that Cribl Stream/Edge will retry after 2 seconds, then 4 seconds, then 8 seconds, and so on.
- **Backoff limit (ms)**: The maximum backoff interval Cribl Stream/Edge should apply for its final retry, in milliseconds. Default (and minimum) is `10,000` (10 seconds); maximum is `180,000` (180 seconds, or 3 minutes).

### Advanced Settings {#advanced-tab}

**Validate server certs**: Toggle on to reject certificates that are **not** authorized by a CA in the **CA certificate path**, nor by another trusted CA (for example, the system's CA).

**Round-robin DNS**: Toggle on to enable round-robin DNS lookup across multiple IP addresses, IPv4 and IPv6. When a DNS server resolves a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) to multiple IP addresses, Cribl Edge will sequentially use each address in the order they are returned by the DNS server for subsequent connection attempts.

**Compress**: Toggle on (default; recommended) to compress the payload body before sending.

**Send counter metrics as 'count'**: Unless toggled on, Datadog might transform `counter` metrics to `gauge`. [Learn more about Datadog metrics types](https://docs.datadoghq.com/metrics/types/?tab=count).

**Batch by tags**: When toggled on (default), log events are batched using both the API key and **Datadog tags** to optimize logical grouping. However, high cardinality in Datadog tags (many unique tag values) can result in excessive concurrent requests and potential `408` errors from Datadog. Toggling this setting off changes the batching behavior to group log events solely by API key, reducing batch count and improving performance.

**Request timeout**: Amount of time (in seconds) to wait for a request to complete before aborting it. Defaults to `30`.

**Request concurrency**: Maximum number of concurrent requests per Worker Process. When Cribl Edge hits this limit, it begins throttling traffic to the downstream service. Defaults to `5`. Minimum: `1`. Maximum: `32`.

**Body size limit (KB)**: Maximum size of the request body before compression. Defaults to `4096` KB. The actual request body size might exceed the specified value because the Destination adds bytes when it writes to the downstream receiver. Cribl recommends that you experiment with the **Body size limit** value until downstream receivers reliably accept all events.

**Buffer memory limit (KB)**: Total amount of memory used to buffer outgoing requests waiting to be sent. If left blank, defaults to 5 times the max body size (if set). If 0, no limit is enforced. This provides granular control over the memory allocated for buffering outgoing batched requests. Increasing the limit allows batches to grow larger before being flushed, improving efficiency for data with high cardinality (a large number of unique batches). Finding the optimal balance between efficient data transfer and memory usage involves adjusting both the **Buffer memory limit** and **Body size limit** settings.

**Events-per-request limit**: Maximum number of events to include in the request body. The `0` default allows unlimited events.

**Flush period (s)**: Maximum time between requests. Low values could cause the payload size to be smaller than its configured maximum. Defaults to `1`.

**Extra HTTP headers**: Name-value pairs to pass as additional HTTP headers. Values will be sent encrypted.

**Failed request logging mode**: Use this drop-down to determine which data should be logged when a request fails. Select among `None` (the default), `Payload`, or `Payload + Headers`. With this last option, Cribl Edge will redact all headers, except non-sensitive headers that you declare below in **Safe headers**. 

**Safe headers**: Add headers to declare them as safe to log in plaintext. (Sensitive headers such as `authorization` will always be redacted, even if listed here.) Use a tab or hard return to separate header names.

**Environment**: If you're using GitOps, optionally use this field to specify a single Git branch on which to enable this configuration. If empty, the config will be enabled everywhere.

## Internal Fields

Cribl Edge uses a set of internal fields to assist in forwarding data to a Destination. 

If an event contains the internal field `__criblMetrics`, Cribl Edge will send it to Datadog as a metric event. Otherwise, Cribl Edge will send it as a log event.

You can use these fields to **override** outbound event values for log events:

  * `ddtags`
  * `__service`
  * `__severity`

No internal fields are supported for metric events.

## Proxying Requests

If you need to proxy HTTP/S requests, see [System Proxy Configuration](proxy-config).

## Troubleshooting

The Destination's configuration modal has helpful tabs for troubleshooting:

**Live Data**: Try capturing [live data](managing-destinations#capture-outgoing-data) to see real-time events as they flow through the Destination. On the **Live Data** tab, click **Start Capture** to begin viewing real-time data.

**Logs**: Review and search the logs that provide detailed information about the delivery process, including any errors or warnings that may have occurred.

**Test**: Ensures that the Destination is correctly set up and reachable. Verify that sample events are sent correctly by clicking **Run Test**.

You can also view the [Monitoring](monitoring) page that provides a comprehensive overview of data volume and rate, helping you identify delivery issues. Analyze the graphs showing events and bytes in/out over time.
