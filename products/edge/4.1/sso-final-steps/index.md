# Final SSO Steps & Troubleshooting


Whether you're integrating with OIDC or SAML, there's one more step for users who had an existing username/password-based login on Cribl.Cloud before SSO was set up. 

Upon first login with SSO, these users will see a prompt to link their identities. They should accept this prompt to ensure that their existing profile is linked with their SSO profile. (This can be a multi-step flow.)
