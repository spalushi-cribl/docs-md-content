## Configuring Cribl Edge to Output to Loki

From the top nav, click **Manage**, then select a **Fleet** to configure. Next, you have two options:

To configure via the graphical [QuickConnect](quickconnect) UI, click Routing > QuickConnect (Stream) or Collect (Edge). Next, click **Add Destination** at right. From the resulting drawer's tiles, select **Loki**. Next, click either **Add Destination** or (if displayed) **Select Existing**. The resulting drawer will provide the options below.

Or, to configure via the [Routing](routes) UI, click **Data** > **Destinations** (Stream) or **More** > **Destinations** (Edge). From the resulting page's tiles or the **Destinations** left nav, select **Loki**. Next, click **Add Destination** to open a **New Destination** modal that provides the options below.

### General Settings

**Output ID**: Enter a unique name to identify this Loki output definition. 

**Loki URL**: The endpoint to send events to, e.g.: `https://logs-prod-us-central1.grafana.net`.

> To proxy outbound HTTP/S requests, see [System Proxy Configuration](proxy-config).

### Optional Settings

**Backpressure behavior**: Whether to block, drop, or queue events when all receivers are exerting backpressure.

**Tags**: Optionally, add tags that you can use for filtering and grouping at the final destination. Use a tab or hard return between (arbitrary) tag names.

### Authentication

Select one of the following options for authentication:

- **None**: Don't use authentication.

- **Auth token**: Use HTTP token authentication. In the resulting **Token** field, enter the bearer token that must be included in the HTTP authorization header.

- **Auth token (text secret)**: This option exposes a drop-down in which you can select a [stored text secret](/stream/securing-and-monitoring#secrets) that references the bearer token described above. A **Create** link is available to store a new, reusable secret.

- **Basic**: This default option displays fields for you to enter HTTP Basic authentication credentials. **Username** is the Loki **User**. **Password** is your API key in the Grafana Cloud domain.

- **Basic (credentials secret)**: This option exposes a **Credentials secret** drop-down, in which you can select a [stored text secret](/stream/securing-and-monitoring#secrets) that references the Basic authentication credentials described above. A **Create** link is available to store a new, reusable secret.

### Persistent Queue Settings

> This tab is displayed when the **Backpressure behavior** is set to **Persistent Queue**. 
> 
> On Cribl-managed [Cribl.Cloud](deploy-cloud) Workers (with an [Enterprise plan](deploy-cloud#enterprise)), this tab exposes only the **Clear Persistent Queue** button. A maximum queue size of 1 GB disk space is automatically allocated per Worker Process. If the queue fills up, Cribl Edge will block outbound data.

{.box .info}

**Max file size**: The maximum data volume to store in each queue file before closing it. Enter a numeral with units of KB, MB, etc. Defaults to `1 MB`.

**Max queue size**: The maximum amount of disk space the queue is allowed to consume. Once this limit is reached, queueing is stopped and data blocking is applied. Enter a numeral with units of KB, MB, etc.

**Queue file path**: The location for the persistent queue files. This will be of the form: `your/path/here/<worker-id>/<output-id>`. Defaults to: `$CRIBL_HOME/state/queues`.

**Compression**: Codec to use to compress the persisted data, once a file is closed. Defaults to `None`. `Gzip` is also available.

**Queue-full behavior**: Whether to block or drop events when the queue is exerting backpressure (because disk is low or at full capacity). **Block** is the same behavior as non-PQ blocking, corresponding to the **Block** option on the **Backpressure behavior** drop-down. **Drop new data** throws away incoming data, while leaving the contents of the PQ unchanged.

**Clear persistent queue**: Click this button if you want to flush out files that are currently queued for delivery to this Destination. A confirmation modal will appear. (Appears only after **Output ID** has been defined.)

**Strict ordering**: The default `Yes` position enables FIFO (first in, first out) event forwarding. When receivers recover, Cribl Edge will send earlier queued events before forwarding newly arrived events. To instead prioritize new events before draining the queue, toggle this off. Doing so will expose this additional control:
- **Drain rate limit (EPS)**: Optionally, set a throttling rate (in events per second) on writing from the queue to receivers. (The default `0` value disables throttling.) Throttling the queue's drain rate can boost the throughput of new/active connections, by reserving more resources for them. You can further optimize Workers' startup connections and CPU load at **Fleet Settings** > [Worker Processes](settings-group-fleet#processes).

### Processing Settings

Loki uses labels to define separate streams of logging data. This is a key concept. Cribl recommends that you familiarize yourself with the [information](https://grafana.com/blog/2020/04/21/how-labels-in-loki-can-make-log-queries-faster-and-easier/) and documentation Grafana provides about labels in Loki.

One canonical example is processing logs from servers in three environments: production, staging, and testing. You could create a label named `env` whose possible values are `prod`, `staging`, and `test`.

One basic principle is that if you set too many labels, you can end up with too many streams.

#### Post‑Processing

**Pipeline**: Pipeline to process data before sending the data out using this output.

**System fields**: A list of fields to automatically add to log events as labels. Supports wildcards. 

By default, includes `cribl_host` (Cribl Edge Node that processed the event) and `cribl_wp` (Cribl Edge Worker Process that processed the event). On the Loki side, this creates different streams, which prevents Loki from rejecting some events as being out of order when different Nodes or Worker Processes are emitting at different rates.  

Other options include:

- `cribl_input` – Cribl Edge Source that processed the event.
- `cribl_output` – Cribl Edge Destination that processed the event.
- `cribl_pipe` – Cribl Edge Pipeline that processed the event.
- `cribl_route` – Cribl Edge Route (or QuickConnect) that processed the event.

### Advanced Settings

**Compress**: When the **Message format** is `JSON`, you can toggle this slider to `Yes` to GZIP-compress the data before sending to Loki. (When the **Message format** is `Protobuf`, data is always [Snappy](http://google.github.io/snappy/)-compressed, so this slider is hidden.)

**Round-robin DNS**: Toggle on to enable round-robin DNS lookup across multiple IP addresses, IPv4 and IPv6. When a DNS server resolves a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) to multiple IP addresses, Cribl Edge will sequentially use each address in the order they are returned by the DNS server for subsequent connection attempts.

**Validate server certs**: Reject certificates that are not authorized by a CA in the **CA certificate path**, or by another trusted CA (e.g., the system's CA). Defaults to `No`.

**Request timeout**: Amount of time (in seconds) to wait for a request to complete before aborting it. Defaults to `30`.

**Request concurrency**: Maximum number of concurrent requests before blocking. This is set per Worker Process. Defaults to `1`.

**Max body size (KB)**: Maximum size of the request body before compression. Defaults to `4096` KB. The actual request body size might exceed the specified value because the Destination adds bytes when it writes to the downstream receiver. Cribl recommends that you experiment with the **Max body size** value until downstream receivers reliably accept all events.

**Max events per request**: Maximum number of events to include in the request body. The `0` default allows unlimited events.

**Flush period (sec)**: Maximum time between requests. Low values could cause the payload size to be smaller than its configured maximum. Defaults to `15`.

**Extra HTTP headers**: Name-value pairs to pass as additional HTTP headers. Values will be sent encrypted.

**Message format**: Whether to send events as `Protobuf` (the default) or `JSON`.

**Logs message field**: The event field to send as log output, for example: `_raw`.  All other event fields are discarded. If left blank, Cribl Edge sends a JSON or Protobuf representation of the whole event.

**Logs labels**: Name/value pairs where the value can be a static or dynamic expression that has access to all log event fields.

**Failed request logging mode**: Determines which data is logged when a request fails. Use the drop-down to select one of these options:

- `None` (default).
- `Payload`.
- `Payload + Headers`. Use the **Safe Headers** field below to specify the headers to log. If you leave that field empty, all headers are redacted, even with this setting. 

**Safe headers**: List the headers you want to log, in plain text.

**Environment**: If you're using GitOps, optionally use this field to specify a single Git branch on which to enable this configuration. If empty, the config will be enabled everywhere.

## Internal Fields {#internal}

Cribl Edge uses internal fields to assist in forwarding data to a Destination. 

* `__labels` specifies labels to add to log events. If a label is set in both the `__labels` field and in Logs labels and/or System fields, Cribl Stream sends the value from `__labels` to Loki. Setting the `__labels` field in a Pipeline gives you a quick way to experiment with the logs being sent.
* `__structuredMetadata` is referenced when the **Send structured metadata** advanced setting is toggled on.
* `__headers` allows you to define custom HTTP headers on a per-event basis when the **Enable dynamic headers** advanced setting is toggled on. Top-level string key-value pairs are supported. Non-string values are ignored.
