# About Cribl Edge


## What Is Cribl Edge?

[Cribl Edge](https://cribl.io/download) helps you collect and process observability data – logs, metrics, and application data – in real time, from your Linux, Windows, and macOS machines, apps, or microservices, and deliver them to Cribl Stream or any supported destination.

With Cribl Edge you can:

- Automatically discover and collect host, container, and application metrics, as well as logs, on endpoints.
- Process data with Functions and Pipelines.
- Forward data to any of the many supported destinations.
- Easily manage configurations while maintaining version control.
- Teleport to the edge for local preview and configuration validation.

> Cribl Edge is not intended for collecting data from multiple hosts.
> If you need to receive and aggregate data from various endpoints, use [Cribl Stream](/stream/) instead.
> Cribl Stream is designed to handle high volume workloads by employing multiple Worker processes.
