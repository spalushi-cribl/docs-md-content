# ipfix-information-elements.yml


`ipfix-information-elements.yml` contains predefined IPFIX fields derived from the [IANA IPFIX Information Elements](https://www.iana.org/assignments/ipfix/ipfix.xhtml) list. This file ensures that Cribl Edge can handle and decode IPFIX fields effectively from the [NetFlow & IPFIX Source](sources-netflow).

      name: tcpControlBits
      type: unsigned16
      status: current
      description: TCP control bits observed for the packets of this Flow. This information is encoded as a bit field; each TCP control bit has a corresponding bit in that field. A bit is set to 1 if any observed packet of this Flow has the corresponding TCP control bit set to 1. The bit is cleared to 0 otherwise. Per [RFC9293], the assignment of TCP control bits is managed by IANA via the "TCP Header Flags" registry [https://www.iana.org/assignments/tcp-parameters/tcp-parameters.xhtml#tcp-header-flags]. Implementers can retrieve the current TCP control bits from that registry, which is authoritative for them. As the most significant 4 bits of octets 12 and 13 (counting from zero) of the TCP header [RFC9293] are used to encode the TCP data offset (header length), the corresponding bits in this Information Element MUST be reported by the Exporter with a value of zero and MUST be ignored by the Collector. Use the tcpHeaderLength Information Element to encode this value. All TCP control bits (including those unassigned) MUST be exported as observed in the TCP headers of the packets of this Flow. If exported as a single octet with reduced-size encoding (Section 6.2 of [RFC7011]), this Information Element covers the low-order octet of this field (i.e., bit offset positions 8 to 15) [https://www.iana.org/assignments/tcp-parameters/tcp-parameters.xhtml#tcp-header-flags]. A Collector receiving this Information Element with reduced-size encoding must not assume anything about the content of the four bits with bit offset positions 4 to 7. Exporting Processes exporting this Information Element on behalf of a Metering Process that is not capable of observing any of the flags with bit offset positions 4 to 7 SHOULD use reduced-size encoding, and only export the least significant 8 bits of this Information Element. Note that previous revisions of this Information Element's definition specified that flags with bit offset positions 8 and 9 must be exported as zero, even if observed. Collectors should therefore not assume that a value of zero for these bits in this Information Element indicates the bits were never set in the observed traffic, especially if these bits are zero in every Flow Record sent by a given Exporter. Note also that the "TCP Header Flags" registry [https://www.iana.org/assignments/tcp-parameters/tcp-parameters.xhtml#tcp-header-flags] indexes the bit offset from the most significant bit of octet 12 to the least significant bit of octet 13 in the TCP header, but the tcpControlBits is encoded as a regular unsigned 16-bit integer.

      description: The value of the VPN route distinguisher of a corresponding entry in a VPN routing and forwarding table. Route distinguisher ensures that the same address can be used in several different MPLS VPNs and that it is possible for BGP to carry several completely different routes to that address, one for each VPN. According to [RFC4364], the size of mplsVpnRouteDistinguisher is 8 octets. However, in [RFC4382] an octet string with flexible length was chosen for representing a VPN route distinguisher by object MplsL3VpnRouteDistinguisher. This choice was made in order to be open to future changes of the size. This idea was adopted when choosing octetArray as abstract data type for this Information Element. The maximum length of this Information Element is 256 octets.

Each bit represents an Information Element in the Data Record, with the n-th least significant bit representing the n-th Information Element. A bit set to value 1 indicates that the corresponding Information Element is a Flow Key of the reported Flow. A bit set to value 0 indicates that this is not the case. If the Data Record contains more than 64 Information Elements, the corresponding Template SHOULD be designed such that all Flow Keys are among the first 64 Information Elements, because the flowKeyIndicator only contains 64 bits. If the Data Record contains less than 64 Information Elements, then the bits in the flowKeyIndicator for which no corresponding Information Element exists MUST have the value 0.

The IPv4 payload is that part of the packet that follows the IPv4 header and any options, which [RFC791] refers to as "data" or "data octets". For example, see the examples in [RFC791], Appendix A. The IPv6 payload is the rest of the packet following the 40-octet IPv6 header. Note that any extension headers present are considered part of the payload. See [RFC8200] for the IPv6 specification.

Description text in multiple languages MAY tag each section with its ownlanguage tag; in this case, the description information in each language SHOULD have equivalent meaning. In the absence of any language tag, the "i-default" [RFC2277] language SHOULD be assumed. See the Security Considerations Section of [RFC5610] for notes on string handling for Information Element type records.

      description: A description of the semantics of an IPFIX Information Element. These are taken from the data type semantics defined in Section 3.2 of the IPFIX Information Model [RFC5102]; see that section for more information on the types defined in the [IPFIX Information Element Semantics] subregistry. This field may take the values in the [IPFIX Information Element Semantics] subregistry. The special value 0x00 (default) is used to note that no semantics apply to the field; it cannot be manipulated by a Collecting Process or File Reader that does not understand it a priori. The [IPFIX Information Element Semantics] subregistry is intended to assign numbers for semantics names, not to provide a mechanism for adding semantics to the IPFIX Protocol, and as such requires a Standards Action [RFC8126] to modify.

To export type information about an IANA-assigned Information Element, set the privateEnterpriseNumber to 0, or do not export the privateEnterpriseNumber in the type record. To export type information about an enterprise-specific Information Element, export the enterprise number in privateEnterpriseNumber, and export the Information Element number with the Enterprise bit cleared in informationElementId. The Enterprise bit in the associated informationElementId Information Element MUST be ignored by the Collecting Process.

      description: A description of the method used to distribute the counters from Contributing Flows into the Aggregated Flow records described by an associated scope, generally a Template. The method is deemed to apply to all the non-key Information Elements in the referenced scope for which value distribution is a valid operation; if the originalFlowsInitiated and/or originalFlowsCompleted Information Elements appear in the Template, they are not subject to this distribution method, as they each infer their own distribution method. The valueDistributionMethod registry is intended to list a complete set of possible value distribution methods.

      description: A set of bit fields that is used for marking the Information Elements of a Data Record that serve as INDEX MIB objects for an indexed columnar MIB object. Each bit represents an Information Element in the Data Record, with the n-th least significant bit representing the n-th Information Element. A bit set to 1 indicates that the corresponding Information Element is an index of the columnar object represented by the mibObjectValue. A bit set to 0 indicates that this is not the case. If the Data Record contains more than 64 Information Elements, the corresponding Template SHOULD be designed such that all index fields are among the first 64 Information Elements, because the mibIndexIndicator only contains 64 bits. If the Data Record contains less than 64 Information Elements, then the extra bits in the mibIndexIndicator for which no corresponding Information Element exists MUST have the value 0 and must be disregarded by the Collector. This Information Element may be exported with IPFIX reduced-size encoding.

      description: Indicates when in the lifetime of the Flow the MIB value was retrieved from the MIB for a mibObjectIdentifier. This is used to indicate if the value exported was collected from the MIB closer to Flow creation or Flow export time and refers to the Timestamp fields included in the same Data Record. This field SHOULD be used when exporting a mibObjectValue that specifies counters or statistics. If the MIB value was sampled by SNMP prior to the IPFIX Metering Process or Exporting Process retrieving the value (i.e., the data is already stale) and it is important to know the exact sampling time, then an additional observationTime* element should be paired with the OID using IPFIX Structured Data [RFC6313]. Similarly, if different MIB capture times apply to different mibObjectValue elements within the Data Record, then individual mibCaptureTimeSemantics Information Elements should be paired with each OID using IPFIX Structured Data. Values are listed in the mibCaptureTimeSemantics registry.

By definition, a NAT mapping can be created from two address realms, one from internal and one from external. Realms are implementation dependent and can represent a Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) ID, a VLAN ID, or some unique identifier. Realms are optional and, when left unspecified, would mean that the external and internal realms are the same.

However, if no sectionOffset field corresponding to this Information Element is present, then a sectionOffset of zero applies, and the octets MUST be from the start of the ICMP header. With sufficient length, this element also reports octets from the ICMP payload. However, full packet capture of arbitrary packet streams is explicitly out of scope per the Security Considerations sections of [RFC5477] and [RFC2804]. The sectionExportedOctets expresses how much data was exported, while the remainder is padding. When the sectionExportedOctets field corresponding to this Information Element exists, this Information Element MAY have a fixed length and MAY be padded, or it MAY have a variable length. When the sectionExportedOctets field corresponding to this Information Element does not exist, this Information Element SHOULD have a variable length and MUST NOT be padded. In this case, the size of the exported section may be constrained due to limitations in the IPFIX protocol.

      description: IPv6 extension headers observed in packets of this Flow. The information is encoded in a set of bit fields. For each IPv6 extension header, there is a bit in this set. The bit is set to 1 if any observed packet of this Flow contains the corresponding IPv6 extension header. Otherwise, if no observed packet of this Flow contains the respective IPv6 extension header, the value of the corresponding bit is 0. The IPv6 extension header associated with each bit is provided in [IANA-IPFIX-IPv6EH]. Bit 0 corresponds to the least-significant bit in the ipv6ExtensionHeadersFull IE while bit 255 corresponds to the most-significant bit of the IE. In doing so, few octets will be needed to encode common IPv6 extension headers when observed in a Flow. The "No Next Header" (bit 2) value (Section 4.7 of [RFC8200]) is used if there is no upper-layer header in an IPv6 packet. Even if the value is not considered as an extension header as such, the corresponding bit is set in the ipv6ExtensionHeadersFull IE whenever that value is encountered in the Flow. Extension headers observed in a Flow with varying extension header chain MUST NOT be grouped in the ipv6ExtensionHeadersFull IE if the ipv6ExtensionHeaderChainLengthList IE is also present. If the ipv6ExtensionHeaderChainLengthList IE is not present, then extension headers observed in a Flow with varying extension header chain MAY be grouped in one single ipv6ExtensionHeadersFull IE or be exported in separate ipv6ExtensionHeadersFull IEs, one for each extension header chain. The ipv6ExtensionHeadersFull IE MUST NOT be exported if ipv6ExtensionHeaderTypeCountList IE is also present because of the overlapping scopes between these two IEs. The value of ipv6ExtensionHeadersFull IE may be encoded in fewer octets per the guidelines in Section 6.2 of [RFC7011]

      description: "As per Section 4.1 of [RFC8200], IPv6 nodes must accept and attempt to process extension headers occurring any number of times in the same packet. This IE echoes the order of extension headers and number of onsecutive occurrences of the same extension header type in a Flow. This IE is a subTemplateList of ipv6ExtensionHeaderType and ipv6ExtensionHeaderCount IEs. Each header chain in Flow with varying extension header chain MUST be exported in a separate IE. The same extension header type may appear several times in an ipv6ExtensionHeaderTypeCountList IE. For example, if an IPv6 packet of a Flow includes a Hop-by-Hop Options header, a Destination Options header, a Fragment header, and Destination Options header, the ipv6ExtensionHeaderTypeCountList IE will report: * the count of Hop-by-Hop Options headers, * the occurrences of the Destination Options headers that are observed before a Fragment header, * the occurrences of the Fragment headers, and * the occurrences of the Destination Options headers that are observed right after a Fragment header. If an implementation determines that an observed packet of a Flow includes an extension header (including an extension header that it does not support), then the exact observed code of that extension header MUST be echoed in the ipv6ExtensionHeaderTypeCountList IE. How an implementation disambiguates between unknown upper-layer protocols vs. extension headers is not IPFIX-specific. Refer, for example, to Section 2.2 of [RFC8883] for a behavior of an intermediate node that encounters an unknown Next Header type."

      description: In theory, there are no limits on the number of IPv6 extension headers that may be present in a packet other than the path MTU. However, it was regularly reported that IPv6 packets with extension headers are often dropped in the Internet (e.g., [RFC7872]). As discussed in Section 1.2 of [RFC8883], some hardware devices implement a parsing buffer of a fixed size to process packets, including all the headers. When the aggregate length of headers of an IPv6 packet exceeds that size, the packet will be discarded or deferred to a slow path. The ipv6ExtensionHeadersChainLength IE is used to report, in octets, the length of an extension header chain observed in a Flow. The length is the sum of the length of all extension headers of the chain. Exporting such information might help identifying root causes of performance degradation, including packet drops. Each header chain length of a Flow with varying extension header chain MUST be exported in a separate ipv6ExtensionHeadersChainLength IE.

      description: TCP options in packets of this Flow. The information is encoded in a set of bit fields. For each TCP option, there is a bit in this set. The bit is set to 1 if any observed packet of this Flow contains the corresponding TCP option. Otherwise, if no observed packet of this Flow contains the respective TCP option, the value of the corresponding bit is 0. Options are mapped to bits according to their option numbers. TCP option Kind 0 corresponds to the least-significant bit in the tcpOptionsFull IE while Kind 255 corresponds to the most-significant bit of the IE. This approach allows an observer to export any observed TCP option even if it does not support that option and without requiring updating a mapping table. The value of tcpOptionsFull IE may be encoded in fewer octets per the guidelines in Section 6.2 of [RFC7011]. The presence of tcpSharedOptionExID16List or tcpSharedOptionExID32List IEs is an indication that a shared TCP option (Kind=253 or 254) is observed in a Flow. The presence of tcpSharedOptionExID16List or tcpSharedOptionExID32List IEs takes precedence over setting the corresponding bits in the tcpOptionsFull IE for the same Flow. In order to optimize the use of the reduced-size encoding in the presence of tcpSharedOptionExID16List or tcpSharedOptionExID32List IEs, the Exporter MUST NOT set to 1 the shared TCP options (Kind=253 or 254) flags of the tcpOptionsFull IE that is reported for the same Flow.
