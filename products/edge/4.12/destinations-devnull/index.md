## Configure Cribl Edge to Forward to DevNull

DevNull requires no configuration: A DevNull Destination is preconfigured and active as soon as you install Cribl Edge. To verify this, follow the direction below.

On the top bar, select **Products**, and then select **Cribl Edge**. Under **Fleets**, select a Fleet. Next, you have two options:

   - To configure via [QuickConnect](quickconnect), navigate to **Routing** > **QuickConnect** (Stream) or **Collect** (Edge). A **DevNull** Destination is preconfigured and ready to use in the right **Destinations** column. 
   - To configure via the [Routes](routes), select **Data** > **Destinations** or **More** > **Destinations** (Edge). Select the Destination you want. From the resulting **Destinations** page, click anywhere on the `devnull` row to proceed.
