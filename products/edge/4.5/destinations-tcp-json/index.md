## Configuring Cribl Edge to Output Data in TCP JSON Format

From the top nav, click **Manage**, then select a **Fleet** to configure. Next, you have two options:

To configure via the graphical [QuickConnect](quickconnect) UI, click Routing > QuickConnect (Stream) or Collect (Edge). Next, click **Add Destination** at right. From the resulting drawer's tiles, select **TCP JSON**. Next, click either **Add Destination** or (if displayed) **Select Existing**. The resulting drawer will provide the options below.
 
Or, to configure via the [Routing](routes) UI, click **Data** > **Destinations** (Stream) or **More** > **Destinations** (Edge). From the resulting page's tiles or the **Destinations** left nav, select **TCP JSON**. Next, click **Add Destination** to open a **New Destination** modal that provides the options below.

### General Settings

**Output ID**: Enter a unique name to identify this Destination definition.

**Load balancing**: When enabled (default), lets you specify multiple destinations. See [Load Balancing Settings](#lb) below. The following two fields appear **only** with the `No` setting.

**Address**: Hostname of the receiver.

**Port**: Port number to connect to on the host.

### Authentication Settings  {#authentication-settings}

Use the **Authentication method** drop-down to select one of these options:

- **Manual**: In the resulting **Auth token** field, you can optionally enter an auth token to use in the connection header.

- **Secret**: This option exposes an **Auth token (text secret)** drop-down, in which you can select a [stored secret](/stream/securing-and-monitoring#secrets) that references the `authToken` header field value described above. A **Create** link is available to store a new, reusable secret.

### Optional Settings

**Exclude current host IPs**: This toggle appears when **Load balancing** is set to `Yes`. It determines whether to exclude all IPs of the current host from the list of any resolved hostnames. Defaults to `No`, which keeps the current host available for load balancing.

**Compression**: Codec to use to compress the data before sending. Defaults to `Gzip`.

**Throttling**: Throttle rate, in bytes per second. Defaults to `0`, meaning no throttling. Multiple-byte units such as KB, MB, GB etc. are also allowed, e.g., `42 MB`. When throttling is engaged, your **Backpressure behavior** selection determines whether Cribl Edge will handle excess data by blocking it, dropping it, or queueing it to disk.

**Backpressure behavior**: Specifies whether to block, drop, or queue events when all receivers are exerting backpressure. Defaults to `Block`. See [Persistent Queue Settings](#pq) below.

**Tags**: Optionally, add tags that you can use to filter and group Destinations in Cribl Edge's **Manage Destinations** page. These tags aren't added to processed events. Use a tab or hard return between (arbitrary) tag names.

### Load Balancing Settings {#lb}

Enabling the **Load balancing** toggle replaces the static **General Settings** > **Address** and **Port** fields with the following controls:

#### Destinations {#destinations}

Use the **Destinations** table to specify a known set of receivers on which to load-balance data. To specify more receivers on new rows, click **Add Destination**. Each row provides the following fields:

**Address**: Hostname of the receiver. Optionally, you can paste in a comma-separated list, in `<host>:<port>` format.

**Port**: Port number to send data to on this host.

**TLS**: Whether to inherit TLS configs from group setting, or disable TLS. Defaults to `inherit`.

**TLS servername**: Servername to use if establishing a TLS connection. If not specified, defaults to connection host (if not an IP). Otherwise, uses the global TLS settings. 

**Load weight**: Set the relative traffic-handling capability for each connection by assigning a weight (> `0`). This column accepts arbitrary values, but for best results, assign weights in the same order of magnitude to all connections. Cribl Edge will attempt to distribute traffic to the connections according to their relative weights.

The final column provides an `X` button to delete any row from the table.

For details on configuring all these options, see [About Load Balancing](load-balancing).

### Persistent Queue Settings {#pq}

> This tab is displayed when the **Backpressure behavior** is set to **Persistent Queue**. 
>
{.box .info}

> On Cribl-managed [Cribl.Cloud](deploy-cloud) Workers (with an [Enterprise plan](cloud-enterprise)), this tab exposes only the destructive **Clear Persistent Queue** button (described below in this section). A maximum queue size of 1 GB disk space is automatically allocated per PQ‑enabled Destination, per Worker Process. The 1 GB limit is on outbound uncompressed data, and no compression is applied to the queue. 
> 
> This limit is not configurable. If the queue fills up, Cribl Edge will block outbound data. To configure the queue size, compression, queue-full fallback behavior, and other options below, use a [hybrid Group](cloud-enterprise#hybrid).
>
{.box .cloud}

**Max file size**: The maximum data volume to store in each queue file before closing it. Enter a numeral with units of KB, MB, etc. Defaults to `1 MB`.

**Max queue size**: The maximum amount of disk space that the queue is allowed to consume on each Worker Process. Once this limit is reached, this Destination will stop queueing data and apply the **Queue‑full** behavior. Required, and defaults to `5` GB. Accepts positive numbers with units of `KB`, `MB`, `GB`, etc. Can be set as high as `1 TB`, unless you've [configured](settings-group-fleet#storage) a different **Max PQ size per Worker Process** in Fleet Settings.

**Queue file path**: The location for the persistent queue files. Defaults to `$CRIBL_HOME/state/queues`. To this value, Cribl Edge will append `/<worker‑id>/<output‑id>`.

**Compression**: Codec to use to compress the persisted data, once a file is closed. Defaults to `None`; `Gzip` is also available.

**Queue-full behavior**: Whether to block or drop events when the queue is exerting backpressure (because disk is low or at full capacity). **Block** is the same behavior as non-PQ blocking, corresponding to the **Block** option on the **Backpressure behavior** drop-down. **Drop new data** throws away incoming data, while leaving the contents of the PQ unchanged.

**Clear Persistent Queue**: Click this "panic" button if you want to delete the files that are currently queued for delivery to this Destination. A confirmation modal will appear - because this will free up disk space by permanently deleting the queued data, without delivering it to downstream receivers. (Appears only after **Output ID** has been defined.)

**Strict ordering**: The default `Yes` position enables FIFO (first in, first out) event forwarding. When receivers recover, Cribl Edge will send earlier queued events before forwarding newly arrived events. To instead prioritize new events before draining the queue, toggle this off. Doing so will expose this additional control:
- **Drain rate limit (EPS)**: Optionally, set a throttling rate (in events per second) on writing from the queue to receivers. (The default `0` value disables throttling.) Throttling the queue's drain rate can boost the throughput of new/active connections, by reserving more resources for them. You can further optimize Workers' startup connections and CPU load at **Fleet Settings** > [Worker Processes](settings-group-fleet#processes).

### TLS Settings (Client Side)

**Use TLS** defaults to `No`. When toggled to `Yes`:

**Autofill?**: This setting is experimental.

**Validate server certs**: Reject certificates that are not authorized by a CA in the **CA certificate path**, or by another trusted CA (e.g., the system's CA). Defaults to `Yes`.

**Server name (SNI)**: Server name for the SNI (Server Name Indication) TLS extension. This must be a host name, not an IP address.

**Minimum TLS version**: Optionally, select the minimum TLS version to use when connecting.

**Maximum TLS version**: Optionally, select the maximum TLS version to use when connecting.

**Certificate name**: The name of the predefined certificate.
 
**CA certificate path**: Path on client containing CA certificates (in PEM format) to use to verify the server's cert. Path can reference `$ENV_VARS`.
 
**Private key path (mutual auth)**: Path on client containing the private key (in PEM format) to use.  Path can reference `$ENV_VARS`. **Use only if mutual auth is required**.
 
**Certificate path (mutual auth)**: Path on client containing certificates in (PEM format) to use. Path can reference `$ENV_VARS`. **Use only if mutual auth is required**. 
 
**Passphrase**: Passphrase to use to decrypt private key.

### Timeout Settings

**Connection timeout**: Amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the connection to establish before retrying. Defaults to `10000`.

**Write timeout**: Amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for a write to complete before assuming connection is dead. Defaults to `60000`.

### Processing Settings

#### Post‑Processing

**Pipeline**: Pipeline to process data before sending the data out using this output.

**System fields**: A list of fields to automatically add to events that use this output. By default, includes `cribl_pipe` (identifying the Cribl Edge Pipeline that processed the event). Supports wildcards. Other options include:

- `cribl_host` – Cribl Edge Node that processed the event.
- `cribl_input` – Cribl Edge Source that processed the event.
- `cribl_output` – Cribl Edge Destination that processed the event.
- `cribl_route` – Cribl Edge Route (or QuickConnect) that processed the event.
- `cribl_wp` – Cribl Edge Worker Process that processed the event.

### Advanced Settings

**Log failed requests to disk**: Toggling to `Yes` makes the payload of the most recently failed request available for inspection. See [Inspect Payload to Troubleshoot Closed Connections](#log-payload) below.

**Environment**: If you're using GitOps, optionally use this field to specify a single Git branch on which to enable this configuration. If empty, the config will be enabled everywhere.

Setting [General Settings](#general-settings) > **Load balancing** to `Yes` adds the following settings:

**DNS resolution period (seconds)**: Re-resolve any hostnames after each interval of this many seconds, and pick up destinations from A records. Defaults to `600` seconds.

**Load balance stats period (seconds)**: Lookback traffic history period. Defaults to `300` seconds.  (Note that If multiple receivers are behind a hostname – i.e., multiple A records – all resolved IPs will inherit the weight of the host, unless each IP is specified separately. In Cribl Edge load balancing, IP settings take priority over those from hostnames.)

**Max connections**: Constrains the number of concurrent receiver connections, per Worker Process, to limit memory utilization. If set to a number &gt; `0`, then on every DNS resolution period, Cribl Edge will randomly select this subset of discovered IPs to connect to. Cribl Edge will rotate IPs in future resolution periods – monitoring weight and historical data, to ensure fair load balancing of events among IPs.

#### Inspect Payload to Troubleshoot Closed Connections {#log-payload}

When a downstream receiver closes connections from this Destination (or just stops responding), inspecting the payload of the most recently failed request can help you find the cause. For example:

* Suppose you send an event whose size is larger than the downstream receiver can handle. 
* Suppose you send an event that has a `number` field, but the value exceeds the highest number that the downstream receiver can handle.

When **Log failed requests to disk** is enabled, you can inspect the last failed request payload. Here is how:

1. In the Destination UI, navigate to the **Logs** tab.
2. Find a log entry with a `connection error` message. 
3. Expand the log entry. 
4. If the message includes the phrase `See payload file for more info`, note the path in the `file` field on the next line.

Now you have the path to the directory where Cribl Edge is storing the payload from the last failed request.

## Format

TCP JSON events are sent in [newline-delimited JSON](https://github.com/ndjson/ndjson-spec) format, consisting of:

1. A header line. Can be empty, e.g.: `{}`. If **Auth Token** is enabled, the token will be included here as a field called `authToken`. In addition, if events contain common fields, they will be included here under `fields`.

2. A JSON event/record per line. 

See an example in our [TCP JSON Source](sources-tcp-json#format) topic.
