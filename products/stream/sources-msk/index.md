# Amazon MSK Source


Cribl Stream supports receiving data records from an Amazon [Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka](https://aws.amazon.com/msk/) (MSK) cluster. This Source automatically detects compressed data in `Gzip`, `Snappy`, `LZ4`, or `ZSTD` format.

> Type: **Pull**  |  TLS Support: **YES** | Event Breaker Support: **No**
> 
> Kafka uses a binary protocol over TCP. It does not support HTTP proxies, so Cribl Stream must receive events directly from senders. You might need to adjust your firewall rules to allow this traffic.

## Configure Cribl Stream to Receive Data from Kafka Topics

1. On the top bar, select **Products**, and then select **Cribl Stream**. Under **Worker Groups**, select a Worker Group. Next, you have two options:
     - To configure via [QuickConnect](quickconnect), navigate to **Routing** > **QuickConnect**. Select **Add Source** and select the Source you want from the list, choosing either **Select Existing** or **Add New**. 
     - To configure via the [Routes](routes), select **Data** > **Sources**. Select the Source you want. Next, select **Add Source**.
2. In the **New Source** modal, configure the following under **General Settings**:
     - **Input ID**: Enter a unique name to identify this Source definition. If you clone this Source, Cribl Stream will add `-CLONE` to the original **Input ID**.
     - **Description**: Optionally, enter a description.
     - **Bootstrap servers**: List of Kafka bootstrap servers to connect to, for example, `kafkaBrokerHost:9092`. Specify hostname and port – for example, `mykafkabroker:9092` – or just hostname, in which case Stream will assign port 9092.
     - **Topics**: Enter the name(s) of topics to subscribe to. Press `Enter`/`Return` between multiple entries.
     - **Region**: Select the name of the [AWS Region](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/) where your Amazon MSK cluster is located. 

> To optimize performance and prevent excessive rebalancing, Cribl recommends subscribing each Kafka Source to only one topic. To subscribe to multiple topics, consider creating a dedicated Kafka Source for each one. 
> 
> For the same reason, the **Group ID** (below) should be unique for each of your Kafka, Confluent Cloud, and Azure Event Hubs Sources. For details, see [Controlling Rebalancing](#controlling-rebalancing).
>
{.box .warning}
3. Next, you can configure the following **Optional Settings**: 
   - **Group ID**: The name of the consumer group to which this Cribl Stream instance belongs.
   - **From beginning**: Toggle this off if you want Cribl Stream, upon subscribing to a topic for the first time, to read new messages only. Otherwise Cribl Stream will read all messages available on the server, starting from the oldest.   
   - **Tags**: Optionally, add tags that you can use for filtering and grouping in Cribl Stream's UI. Use a tab or hard return between (arbitrary) tag names. These tags aren't added to processed events.
4. Optionally, you can adjust the [TLS](#tls), [Authentication](#auth), [Assume Role](#assume), [Processing](#processing), [Retries](#retries), and [Advanced](#advanced-tab) settings, or [Connected Destinations](#connected) outlined in the sections below.
5. Select **Save**, then **Commit & Deploy**. 

### TLS Settings (Client Side) {#tls}

> For Amazon MSK Sources and Destinations:
> * IAM is the only type of authentication that Cribl Stream supports. 
> * Because IAM auth requires TLS, TLS is automatically enabled.
>
{.box .info}

**Validate server certs**: Reject certificates that are **not** authorized by a CA in the **CA certificate path**, or by another trusted CA (such as the system's CA). Defaults to toggled on.

**Server name (SNI)**: Leave this field blank. See [Connecting to Kafka](#connecting) below.

**Certificate**: Select an existing certificate name from the drop-down or add a new certificate by selecting **Create**. See [Add a TLS Certificate to a Worker Group](securing-sources-dest#add-certificate-to-group) for details.

**CA certificate path**: Path on client containing CA certificates (in PEM format) to use to verify the server's cert. Path can reference `$ENV_VARS`.

**Private key path (mutual auth)**: Path on client containing the private key (in PEM format) to use.  Path can reference `$ENV_VARS`. **Use only if mutual auth is required**.

**Certificate path (mutual auth)**: Path on client containing certificates in (PEM format) to use. Path can reference `$ENV_VARS`. **Use only if mutual auth is required**. 

**Passphrase**: Passphrase to use to decrypt private key.

**Minimum TLS version**: Optionally, select the minimum TLS version to accept from connections.

**Maximum TLS version**: Optionally, select the maximum TLS version to accept from connections.

### Authentication {#auth}

Use the **Authentication method** drop-down to select an AWS authentication method.

**Auto**: This default option uses the [AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html) to automatically obtain credentials in the following order of attempts:

1. **IAM Roles for Amazon EC2**: Loaded from AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles attached to an EC2 instance.
1. **Shared Credentials File**: Loaded from the shared credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials`).
1. **Environment Variables**: Loaded from environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
1. **JSON File on Disk**: Loaded from a JSON file on disk.
1. **Other Credential-Provider Classes**: Other credential-provider classes provided by the AWS SDK for JavaScript.

The `Auto` method works both when running on AWS and in other environments where the necessary credentials are available through one of the above methods.

> ##### SSO Providers
> When using the auto authentication method, you can leverage SSO providers like [SAML](usecase-sso-saml#temp-access) and [Okta](usecase-sso-okta#temp-access) to issue temporary credentials. These credentials should be set in the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. The AWS SDK will then use these environment variables to authenticate.
{.box .info}

**Manual**: If not running on AWS, you can select this option to enter a static set of user-associated IAM credentials (your access key and secret key) directly or by reference. This is useful for Workers not in an AWS VPC, such as those running in a private cloud. The **Manual** option exposes these corresponding additional fields:
- **Access key**: Enter your AWS access key. If not present, will fall back to the `env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` environment variable, or to the metadata endpoint for IAM role credentials.
- **Secret key**: Enter your AWS secret key. If not present, will fall back to the `env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable, or to the metadata endpoint for IAM credentials.

**Secret**: If not running on AWS, you can select this option to supply a stored secret that references an AWS access key and secret key. The **Secret** option exposes this additional field:
- **Secret key pair**: Use the drop-down to select an API key/secret key pair that you've [configured](securing-secrets) in Cribl Stream's secrets manager. A **Create** link is available to store a new, reusable secret.

### Assume Role {#assume}

When using **Assume Role** to access resources in a different Region than Cribl Stream, you can target the [AWS Security Token Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html) (STS) endpoint specific to that Region by using the `CRIBL_AWS_STS_REGION` environment variable on your Worker Node. To specify a custom STS endpoint, set the `CRIBL_AWS_STS_ENDPOINT` environment variable. If both are set, `CRIBL_AWS_STS_ENDPOINT` takes precedence. Setting an invalid Region or endpoint results in a fallback to the global STS endpoint.

**Enable for MSK**: Toggle on to use Assume Role credentials to access MSK.

**AssumeRole ARN**: Enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role to assume.

**External ID**: Enter the External ID to use when assuming role. This is required only when assuming a role that requires this ID in order to delegate third-party access. For details, see [AWS' documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html).

**Duration (seconds)**: Duration of the Assumed Role's session, in seconds. Minimum is 900 (15 minutes). Maximum is 43200 (12 hours). Defaults to 3600 (1 hour).

### Processing Settings {#processing}

#### Fields 

In this section, you can define new fields or modify existing ones using JavaScript expressions, similar to the [Eval](eval-function) function. 

* The **Field Name** can either be a new field (unique within the event) or an existing field name to modify its value.
* The **Value** is a JavaScript expression (enclosed in quotes or backticks) to compute the field's value (can be a constant). Select this field's advanced mode icon (far right) if you'd like to open a modal where you can work with sample data and iterate on results.

This flexibility means you can:

* Add new fields to enrich the event.
* Modify existing fields by overwriting their values.
* Compute logic or transformations using JavaScript expressions.

#### Pre-Processing

In this section's **Pipeline** drop-down list, you can select a single existing [Pipeline](pipelines) or [Pack](packs) to process data from this input before the data is sent through the Routes.

### Retries

These settings provide flexibility in handling retries for failed messages, allowing you to balance between quick retries and avoiding excessive load on the system.

The default configuration starts with a 300 milliseconds retry interval, doubles the interval after each retry, and caps the maximum retry interval at 30 seconds. The system will attempt to retry the request up to five times before considering it a failure.

**Retry limit**: Maximum number of times to retry a failed request before the message fails. Defaults to `5`. Enter `0` to not retry at all. For example, if set to `5`, the system will attempt to retry the request up to five times before considering it a failure.

**Initial retry interval (ms)**: Initial value used to calculate the retry interval, in milliseconds. This value determines the starting point for the retry delay. The default (and minimum) is `300` ms (three seconds). The maximum allowed value is `600000` ms (10 minutes). For example, if set to `1000` ms, the first retry will occur after one second.

**Backoff multiplier**: Set the backoff multiplier (`2-20`) to control the retry frequency for failed messages. The multiplier is used in an exponential backoff formula to increase the delay between retries. For faster retries, use a lower multiplier. For slower retries with more delay between attempts, use a higher multiplier. For example, with an initial retry interval of `1000` ms and a multiplier of `2`, the retry intervals will be 1,000 ms, 2,000 ms, 4,000 ms, and so on. See the Kafka [documentation](https://kafka.js.org/docs/retry-detailed) for details.

**Backoff limit (ms)**: The maximum wait time for a retry, in milliseconds. This setting caps the exponential backoff delay to prevent excessively long wait times. The default (and minimum) value is `30000` ms (30 seconds), and the maximum is `180000` ms (180 seconds). For example, if the calculated retry interval exceeds 180,000 ms, the retry will occur after 180,000 ms instead.

### Advanced Settings {#advanced-tab}

Use these settings to fine-tune Cribl Stream's integration with Kafka topics. If you are unfamiliar with these parameters, contact Cribl Support to understand the implications of changing the defaults.

**Heartbeat interval (ms)**: Expected time between heartbeats to the consumer coordinator when using Kafka's group management facilities. Value must be lower than `sessionTimeout`, and typically should not exceed 1/3 of the `sessionTimeout` value. Defaults to `3000` ms (3 seconds). For details, see the [Kafka documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#consumerconfigs_heartbeat.interval.ms).

**Session timeout (ms)**: Timeout used to detect client failures when using Kafka's group management facilities. If the client sends the broker no heartbeats before this timeout expires, the broker will remove this client from the group, and will initiate a rebalance. Value must be between the broker's configured `group.min.session.timeout.ms` and `group.max.session.timeout.ms`. Defaults to `30000` ms (30 seconds). For details, see the [Kafka documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#consumerconfigs_session.timeout.ms).

**Rebalance timeout (ms)**: Maximum allowed time for each Worker to join the Group after a rebalance has begun. If the timeout is exceeded, the coordinator broker will remove the Worker from the Group.  Defaults to `60000` ms (1 minute). For details, see the [Kafka documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connectconfigs_rebalance.timeout.ms).

**Connection timeout (ms)**: Maximum time to wait for a connection to complete successfully. Defaults to `10000` ms (10 seconds). Valid range is `1000` to `3600000` ms (1 second to 1 hour). For details, see the [Kafka documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#brokerconfigs_sasl.login.connect.timeout.ms).

**Request timeout (ms)**: Maximum time to wait for Kafka to respond to a request. Defaults to `60000` ms (1 minute). For details, see the [Kafka documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#brokerconfigs_offsets.commit.timeout.ms).

**Authentication timeout (ms)**: Maximum time to wait for Kafka to respond to an authentication request. Defaults to `1000` (1 second).

**Reauthentication threshold (ms)**: If the broker requires periodic reauthentication, this setting defines how long before the reauthentication timeout Cribl Stream initiates the reauthentication. Defaults to `10000` (10 seconds).

A small value for this setting, combined with high network latency, might prevent the Source from reauthenticating before the Kafka broker closes the connection.

A large value might cause the Source to send reauthentication messages too soon, wasting bandwidth.

The Kafka setting `connections.max.reauth.ms` controls the reuthentication threshold on the Kafka side.

**Offset commit interval (ms)**: How often, in milliseconds, to commit offsets. If both this field and the **Offset commit threshold** are empty, Cribl Stream will commit offsets after each batch. If both fields are set, Cribl Stream will commit offsets when either condition is met.

**Offset commit threshold**: How many events are needed to trigger an offset commit. If both this field and the **Offset commit interval** are empty, Cribl Stream will commit offsets after each batch. If both fields are set, Cribl Stream will commit offsets when either condition is met.

**Max bytes per partition**: Maximum amount of data that Kafka will return per partition, per fetch request. Must equal or exceed the maximum message size (maxBytesPerPartition) that Kafka is configured to allow. Otherwise, Cribl Stream can get stuck trying to retrieve messages. Defaults to `1048576 (1 MB)`.

**Max bytes**: Maximum number of bytes that Kafka will return per fetch request. Defaults to `10485760 (10 MB)`.

**Maximum number of errors per socket**: Maximum number of consecutive request errors that can occur on a single socket connection before the connection is discarded and reestablished. This mitigates issues with idle connections, particularly those used for sending heartbeats, thereby reducing the number of rebalances in a consumer group. Default is `0`, which disables this feature. Accepts values `1-100`.

**Environment**: If you're using GitOps, optionally use this field to specify a single Git branch on which to enable this configuration. If empty, the config will be enabled everywhere.

> If you observe an excessive number of group rebalances, and/or you observe consumers not regularly pulling messages, try increasing the values of **Heartbeat interval**, **Session timeout**, and **Rebalance timeout**.

### Connected Destinations {#connected}

Select **Send to Routes** to enable conditional routing, filtering, and cloning of this Source's data via the Routing table.

Select **QuickConnect** to send this Source’s data to one or more Destinations via independent, direct connections.

## Connecting to Kafka {#connecting} 

> ##### Leave the **TLS Settings** > **Server name (SNI)** field blank
>
> In Cribl Stream's Kafka-based Sources and Destinations (including this one), the Kafka library that Cribl Stream uses manages SNI (Server Name Indication) without any input from Cribl Stream. Therefore, you should leave the **TLS Settings** > **Server name (SNI)** field blank.
> 
> Setting this field in the Cribl Stream UI can cause traffic to be routed to the wrong brokers, because it interferes with the Kafka library's operation.
>
{.box .warning}

Connecting to a Kafka cluster involves using hostnames for two key components: bootstrap servers and brokers.

Brokers are servers that comprise the storage layer in a Kafka cluster. Bootstrap servers handle the initial connection to the Kafka cluster, and then return the list of brokers. A broker list can run into the hundreds. Every Kafka cluster has a `bootstrap.servers` [property](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/iis/11.7?topic=kafka-setting-up-server), defined as either a single `hostname:port` K-V pair, or a list of them. If Cribl Stream tries to connect via one bootstrap server and that fails, Cribl Stream then tries another one on the list.

In the **General Settings** > **Bootstrap servers** list, you can enter either the hostnames of brokers that your Kafka server has been configured to use, or, the hostnames of one or more bootstrap servers. If Kafka returns a list of brokers that's longer than the list you entered, Cribl Stream keeps the full list internally. Cribl Stream neither saves the list nor makes it available in the UI. The connection process simply starts at the beginning whenever the Source or Destination is started.

Here's an overview of the connection process:

1. From the **General Settings** > **Bootstrap servers** list – where each broker is listed as a hostname and port – Cribl Stream takes a hostname and resolves it to an IP address.

2. Cribl Stream makes a connection to that IP address. Notwithstanding the fact that Cribl Stream resolved **one** particular hostname to that IP address, there may be **many** services running at that IP address – each with its own distinct hostname.

3. Cribl Stream establishes TLS security for the connection.

Although SNI is managed by the Kafka library rather than in the Cribl Stream UI, you might want to know how it fits into the connection process. The purpose of the SNI is to specify one hostname – that is, service – among many that might be running on a given IP address within a Kafka cluster. Excluding the other services is one way that TLS makes the connection more secure.

## Internal Fields

Cribl Stream uses a set of internal fields to assist in handling of data. These "meta" fields are **not** part of an event, but they are accessible, and [Functions](functions) can use them to make processing decisions.

Fields for this Source:

  * `__inputId`
  * `__topicIn` (indicates the Kafka topic that the event came from; see `__topicOut` in our [Kafka Destination](destinations-kafka) documentation)
  * `__partition`
  * ` __schemaId` (when using Schema Registry)
  * `__key` (when using Schema Registry)
  * `__headers` (when using Schema Registry)
  * `__keySchemaIdIn` (when using Schema Registry)
  * `__valueSchemaIdIn` (when using Schema Registry) 

## How Cribl Stream Pulls Data

Kafka treats all the Worker Nodes as members of a Consumer Group, and Kafka manages each Node’s data load. By default, Workers will poll every 5 seconds. In the case of Leader failure, Worker Nodes will continue to receive data as normal.



## How Cribl Stream Handles the `_time` Field

Events that the Kafka Source emits always contain a `_time` field, and sometimes also an `__origTime` field. Here's how Cribl Stream determines what to send:

* If the incoming Kafka message contains no `_time` field, the message's timestamp becomes the value of the emitted event's `_time` field.
* If the incoming Kafka message contains a `_time` field whose value is a timestamp in UNIX epoch time, that timestamp becomes the value of the emitted event's `_time` field.
* If the incoming Kafka message contains a `_time` field whose value is **not** a timestamp in UNIX epoch time (for example, an ISO or UTC timestamp), that becomes the value of the emitted event's `__origTime` field, **and** the message's timestamp becomes the value of the emitted event's `_time` field.

## Randomized Partition Assignment

In Cribl Stream 4.8.2 and newer, partition assignment is randomized. The Worker Processes selected to consume data during partition assignment are selected randomly, reducing the possibility of uneven load distribution when there are fewer partitions than Worker Processes. Note that *random* assignment is not the same as *balanced* assignment, and even distribution of work is not guaranteed.

## Controlling Rebalancing {#controlling-rebalancing}

When you configure multiple Sources that subscribe to different topics but all belong to the same consumer group, a state change affecting any Source in this consumer group will affect all the other Sources. Examples of state changes include: deploying new configs, adding or removing Worker Processes, and Worker Processes crashing.

Here’s an example – three Sources, three different topics, all in one consumer group:
- `Source_1 - Topic_1 - ConsumerGroup1`
- `Source_2 - Topic_2 - ConsumerGroup1`
- `Source_3 - Topic_3 - ConsumerGroup1`

Imagine that Source 1 undergoes a state change event, such as a Worker Process crash. Source 2 and Source 3 will rebalance – stopping data flow until the rebalance completes. 

#### Shared Worker Group Mitigation

If Sources that share a consumer group all deploy as part of the same Worker Group, changes will have smaller side effects than when Sources are spread across different Worker Groups. (Conversely, imagine a configuration where deploying new configs for Worker Group 1 caused rebalancing of topics in Worker Worker Group 2. This spillover would be especially undesirable.)

#### Bottom Line

Changes to any member of a consumer group affect all other members of that consumer group. To prevent this undesired behavior, make sure to use a unique **Group ID** for each Kafka, Confluent Cloud, Amazon MSK, and Azure Event Hubs Source.

## Troubleshooting

The Source's configuration modal has helpful tabs for troubleshooting:

**Live Data**: Try capturing [live data](sources#capture-source-data) to see real-time events as they are ingested. On the **Live Data** tab, click **Start Capture** to begin viewing real-time data.

**Logs**: Review and search the logs that provide detailed information about the ingestion process, including any errors or warnings that may have occurred.

You can also view the [Monitoring](monitoring) page that provides a comprehensive overview of data volume and rate, helping you identify ingestion issues. Analyze the graphs showing events and bytes in/out over time.
