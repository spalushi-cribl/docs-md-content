## Configuring Cribl Stream to Forward to DevNull

DevNull requires no configuration: A DevNull Destination is preconfigured and active as soon as you install Cribl Stream.

To verify this, from the top nav, click **Manage**, then select a **Worker Group** to configure. Next, select **Data** > **Destinations** (Stream) or **More** > **Destinations** (Edge). From the resulting page's tiles or the **Destinations** left nav, select **Devnull**. Look for the **Live** indicator at the top right.

In the [QuickConnect](quickconnect) UI, click **Collect** (Edge only), a **DevNull** Destination is preconfigured and ready to use in the right **Destinations** column.
