# Raw HTTP/S


Cribl Stream supports receiving raw HTTP data. The Raw HTTP Source listens on a specific port, captures every HTTP request to that port, and creates a corresponding event that it pushes to its configured Event Breakers.

> Type: **Push**  |  TLS Support: **YES** | Event Breaker Support: **YES**
> 
> This Source supports gzip-compressed inbound data when the `Content‑Encoding: gzip` connection header is set.

## Configuring Cribl Stream to Receive Raw HTTP Data

From the top nav, click **Manage**, then select a **Worker Group** to configure. Next, you have two options:

To configure via the graphical [QuickConnect](quickconnect) UI, click Routing > QuickConnect (Stream) or Collect (Edge). Next, click **Add Source** at left. From the resulting drawer's tiles, select [**Pull** > ]  **Raw HTTP**. Next, click either **Add Destination** or (if displayed) **Select Existing**. The resulting drawer will provide the options below.
 
Or, to configure via the [Routing](routes) UI, click **Data** > **Sources** (Stream) or **More** > **Sources** (Edge). From the resulting page's tiles or left nav, select [**Pull** > ]  **Raw HTTP**. Next, click **New Source** to open a **New Source** modal that provides the options below.

### General Settings

**Input ID**: Enter a unique name to identify this Raw HTTP Source definition. 

**Address**: Enter the address to bind on. Defaults to `0.0.0.0` (all addresses).

**Port**: Enter the port number to listen on.

### Authentication Settings

**Auth tokens**: Shared secrets to be provided by any client. Click **Generate** to create a new secret. If empty, permits open access.

### Optional Settings

**Tags**: Optionally, add tags that you can use to filter and group Sources in Cribl Stream's **Manage Sources** page. These tags aren't added to processed events. Use a tab or hard return between (arbitrary) tag names.

### TLS Settings (Server Side)

**Enabled** defaults to `No`. When toggled to `Yes`:

**Certificate name**: Name of the predefined certificate.

**Private key path**: Server path containing the private key (in PEM format) to use. Path can reference `$ENV_VARS`.

**Passphrase**: Passphrase to use to decrypt private key.  

**Certificate path**: Server path containing certificates (in PEM format) to use. Path can reference `$ENV_VARS`.

**CA certificate path**: Server path containing CA certificates (in PEM format) to use. Path can reference `$ENV_VARS`.

**Authenticate client (mutual auth)**: Require clients to present their certificates. Used to perform mutual authentication using SSL certs. Defaults to `No`. When toggled to `Yes`:

- **Validate client certs**: Reject certificates that are not authorized by a CA in the **CA certificate path**, or by another trusted CA (e.g., the system's CA). Defaults to `Yes`.

- **Common name**: Regex matching subject common names in peer certificates allowed to connect. Defaults to `.*`. Matches on the substring after `CN=`. As needed, escape regex tokens to match literal characters. E.g., to match the subject `CN=worker.cribl.local`, you would enter: `worker\.cribl\.local`.

**Minimum TLS version**: Optionally, select the minimum TLS version to accept from connections.

**Maximum TLS version**: Optionally, select the maximum TLS version to accept from connections.

### Persistent Queue Settings {#pq}

In this section, you can optionally specify [persistent queue](persistent-queues) storage, using the following controls. This will buffer and preserve incoming events when a downstream Destination is down, or exhibiting backpressure.

> On Cribl-managed [Cribl.Cloud](deploy-cloud) Workers (with an [Enterprise plan](deploy-cloud#enterprise)), this tab exposes only the **Enable Persistent Queue** toggle. If enabled, PQ is automatically configured in `Always On` mode, with a maximum queue size of 1 GB disk space allocated per Worker Process.
>
{.box .cloud}

**Enable Persistent Queue**: Defaults to `No`. When toggled to `Yes`:

**Mode**: Select a condition for engaging persistent queues.
- `Always On`: This default option will always write events to the persistent queue, before forwarding them to Cribl Stream's data processing engine.
- `Smart`: This option will engage PQ only when the Source detects backpressure from Cribl Stream's data processing engine.

**Max buffer size**: The maximum number of events to hold in memory before reporting backpressure to the Source. Defaults to `1000`.

**Commit frequency**: The number of events to send downstream before committing that Stream has read them. Defaults to `42`.

**Max file size**: The maximum data volume to store in each queue file before closing it and (optionally) applying the configured **Compression**. Enter a numeral with units of KB, MB, etc. If not specified, Cribl Stream applies the default `1 MB`.

**Max queue size**: The maximum amount of disk space that the queue is allowed to consume, on each Worker Process. Once this limit is reached, Cribl Stream will stop queueing data, and will apply the **Queue‑full behavior**. Enter a numeral with units of KB, MB, etc. If not specified, the implicit `0` default will enable Cribl Stream to fill all available disk space on the volume.

**Queue file path**: The location for the persistent queue files. Defaults to `$CRIBL_HOME/state/queues`. To this field's specified path, Cribl Stream will append `/<worker-id>/inputs/<input-id>`.

**Compression**: Optional codec to compress the persisted data after a file is closed. Defaults to `None`; `Gzip` is also available.

> As of Cribl Stream 4.1, Source-side PQ's default **Mode** changed from `Smart` to `Always on`. This option more reliably ensures events' delivery, and the change does not affect existing Sources' configurations. However:
> - If you create Stream Sources programmatically, and you want to enforce the previous `Smart` mode, you'll need to update your existing code.
> - If you enable `Always on`, this can reduce data throughput. As a trade-off for data durability, you might need to either accept slower throughput, or provision more machines/faster disks.
> - You can optimize Workers' startup connections and CPU load at **Group Settings** > [Worker Processes](settings-group-fleet#processes).

### Processing Settings

#### Event Breakers

**Event Breaker rulesets**: A list of event breaking rulesets that will be applied to the input data stream before the data is sent through the Routes. Defaults to `System Default Rule`.

**Event Breaker buffer timeout**: How long (in milliseconds) the Event Breaker will wait for new data to be sent to a specific channel, before flushing out the data stream, as-is, to the Routes. Minimum `10` ms, default `10000` (10 sec), maximum `43200000` (12 hours).

#### Fields 

In this section, you can add Fields to each event using [Eval](eval-function)-like functionality. 
  * **Name**: Field name.
  * **Value**: JavaScript expression to compute field's value, enclosed in quotes or backticks. (Can evaluate to a constant.)

#### Pre-Processing

In this section's **Pipeline** drop-down list, you can select a single existing Pipeline to process data from this input before the data is sent through the Routes.

### Advanced Settings

**Enable Proxy Protocol**: Toggle to `Yes` if the connection is proxied by a device that supports [Proxy Protocol](https://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt) v1 or v2. This setting affects how the Source handles the [`__srcIpPort` field](#src-ip-port).

**Allowed URI paths**: List of URI paths accepted by this input. Supports wildcards, e.g., `/api/v*/hook`. Defaults to `*`, which allows all paths.

**Allowed HTTP methods**: List of HTTP methods accepted by this input. Supports wildcards, e.g., `P*, GET`. Defaults to `*`, which allows all methods.

**Max active requests**: Maximum number of active requests allowed for this Source, per Worker Process. Defaults to `256`. Enter `0` for unlimited.

**Environment**: If you're using GitOps, optionally use this field to specify a single Git branch on which to enable this configuration. If empty, the config will be enabled everywhere.

**Socket timeout (seconds)**: How long Cribl Stream should wait before assuming that an inactive socket has timed out. The default `0` value means wait forever.

**Request timeout (seconds)**: How long to wait for an incoming request to complete before aborting it. The default `0` value means wait indefinitely.

**Keep-alive timeout (seconds)**: After the last response is sent, Cribl Stream will wait this long for additional data before closing the socket connection. Defaults to `5` seconds; minimum is `1` second; maximum is `600` seconds (10 minutes).

> The longer the **Keep‑alive timeout**, the more Cribl Stream will reuse connections. The shorter the timeout, the closer Cribl Stream gets to creating a new connection for every request. When request frequency is high, you can use longer timeouts to reduce the number of connections created, which mitigates the associated cost.

### Connected Destinations

Select **Send to Routes** to enable conditional routing, filtering, and cloning of this Source's data via the Routing table.

Select **QuickConnect** to send this Source’s data to one or more Destinations via independent, direct connections.

## Internal Fields

Cribl Stream uses a set of internal fields to assist in handling of data. These "meta" fields are **not** part of an event, but they are accessible, and [functions](functions) can use them to make processing decisions.

Fields for this Source:

  * `__channel`
  * `__headers` – Automatically includes any headers sent with request.
  * `__inputId`
  * `__srcIpPort` – See details [below](#src-ip-port).

### Overriding `__srcIpPort` with Client IP/Port {#src-ip-port}

The `__srcIpPort` field's value contains the IP address and (optionally) port of the HTTP client sending data to this Source.

When any proxies (including load balancers) lie between the HTTP client and the Source, the last proxy adds an `X‑Forwarded‑For` header whose value is the IP/port of the original client. With multiple proxies, this header's value will be an array, whose first item is the original client IP/port.

If `X‑Forwarded‑For` is present, and **Advanced Settings** > **Enable proxy protocol** is set to `No`, the original client IP/port in this header will override the value of `__srcIpPort`. 

If **Enable proxy protocol** is set to `Yes`, the `X‑Forwarded‑For` header's contents will **not** override the `__srcIpPort` value. (Here, the upstream proxy can convey the client IP/port without using this header.)
