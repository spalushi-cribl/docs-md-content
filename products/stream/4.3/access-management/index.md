# Access Management


Cribl Stream provides a range of access-management features for users with different security requirements. For details, see the following topics:

- [Authentication](authentication): Authenticating users in Cribl Stream.
- [Members and Permissions](members): Fine-grained access control, available in Cribl Stream 4.2 and later.
- [Local Users](local-users): Creating and managing users in Cribl Stream's original Role-based model.
- [Roles](roles): Managing Roles and Policies to assign to users, in Cribl Stream's original RBAC model.

> Permission- and Role-based access control can be enabled only on distributed deployments ([Stream](/stream/deploy-distributed), [Edge](/edge/setting-up-leader-and-edge-nodes)) with an [Enterprise license](licensing). With other license types and/or single-instance deployments ([Stream](/stream/deploy-single-instance), [Edge](/edge/deploy-single-instance)), all users will have full administrative privileges.
