## What Is Cribl Stream? {#what}

[Cribl Stream](https://cribl.io) helps you process machine data – logs, instrumentation data, application data, metrics, etc. – in real time, and deliver them to your analysis platform of choice. It allows you to:

+ Add context to your data, by enriching it with information from external data sources.
+ Help secure your data, by redacting, obfuscating, or encrypting sensitive fields.
+ Optimize your data, per your performance and cost requirements.

## How Can I Get Started with Cribl Stream? {#how}

You can quickly create a [Cribl.Cloud](deploy-cloud) account to get Cribl Stream running on infrastructure that Cribl manages on your behalf. Or you can [deploy Cribl Stream software](deploy-types) on your own infrastructure, Kubernetes Pods, or containers. For differences between these options, see these topics:

- [Why Use Cloud Deployment?](deploy-cloud#why-use-cloud-deployment)
- [Cribl.Cloud vs. Self-Hosted](cloud-vs-self-hosted)

Both options offer a range of [free and paid](https://cribl.io/pricing/) alternatives. With an [Enterprise Cloud plan](cloud-enterprise), you have the additional option of a hybrid deployment. Here, Cribl manages the control plane (Leader) for you on Cribl.Cloud, but your data plane (Workers) can run on any mix of Cribl-managed versus self-hosted infrastructure.
