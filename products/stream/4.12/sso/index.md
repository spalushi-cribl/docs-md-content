# SSO


Setting up single sign-on (SSO) lets you manage access to Cribl Stream
by using an external identity provider (IDP).
It simplifies user and permission management
and lets you offer a secure, integrated login experience to your users.

See how to set up SSO integration:

- [In Cribl.Cloud](sso-cloud),
- [In an on-prem deployment](sso-on-prem).

> One IDP can connect one email domain to only one Cribl Organization.
> If you need to place users with one email domain into separate groups,
> you can take advantage of [Workspaces](workspaces) to get isolated instances in your Organization,
> and create [Teams](teams) to organize the users.
