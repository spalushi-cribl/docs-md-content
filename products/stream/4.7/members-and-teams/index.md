# Members and Teams


One of the main benefits of Workspaces is the ability to granularly control which users have access to which parts of the system. Access management is done though assigning permissions to individual [Members](members) and [Teams](teams) within a Workspace.

If a Member has overlapping assigned permissions, the highest permission is given.

### Members

To invite new users to your Organization:

1. In the global navigation pane, expand **Organization** and then select **Members**.
2. Select **Invite Members**.
3. Enter email addresses for the new users. 
4. Under **Permissions**, select a Member permission. When you choose the **Member** permission, configure [access for each Cribl product](members#permissions-product) separately.<br/>Or, select the check box next to one or more Workspaces
  and choose a permission under **Set bulk permission**.
  This permission will then be granted to the user for all selected Workspaces.
5. When finished, click **Send Invite**.





### Teams

You can also assign Workspace permissions to whole [Teams](teams) during their creation.

See [Create a Team](teams#create-a-team) for a detailed procedure.
