# Azure Event Hubs Integrations


You can create an Azure Event Hub which sends data to a Cribl Stream Azure Event Hubs Source.

Your Azure Event Hubs account must be at the Standard (or a higher) pricing tier, because the Basic pricing tier does not support the [PLAIN authentication method](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4616) Cribl Stream uses for Event Hubs.

## Prepare Azure Event Hubs to Send Data to Cribl Stream

First, create an Azure Event Hub as described in the [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-create).

For purposes of this tutorial, we assume that in the **Create Namespace** page, you will use `CriblTest` as your **Namespace name**.

Collect the information you will need when configuring Cribl Stream:

1.  In the **Deployment** page, click **Go to Resource**. 

2. Write down the **Host Name**.

3. {{< id `connection-string` >}} Click **Shared Access Policies** to open the page  where you can select policies for your Event Hubs Namespace, and then click `RootManageSharedAccessKey` to show details for that policy.

4. Copy and securely store the **Connection String-primary key**.

## Configure the Azure Event Hubs Source in Cribl Stream

1. From a Cribl Stream instance's or Group's **Manage** submenu, select **Data** > **Sources**, then select **Azure Event Hubs** from the **Manage Sources** page's tiles or left nav. Click **New Source** to open the **Azure Event Hubs** > **New Source** modal.

2.  In the **General Settings** tab, enter the following values:

    - **InputId**: `LogStream`.
    - **Brokers**: To the Host Name you wrote down earlier, append port 9093, and enter the result. For example: `CriblTest.servicebus.windows.net:9093`.
    - **Event Hub Name**: The name of your Azure Event Hub, for example: `CriblTest`. This is equivalent to a [Kafka topic](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-for-kafka-ecosystem-overview#kafka-and-event-hub-conceptual-mapping).
    - **Group ID**: Keep (or change, if desired) the default value (`Cribl`).

6. In the **Authentication** tab, enter or select the following values:

    - **SASL mechanism**:  `PLAIN` (the only supported option).
    - **Username**: `$ConnectionString` (the default generated by Azure).
    - **Authentication Method**: Select `Manual` to use the Connection String Key generated by Azure Event Hubs.
    - **Password**: Enter the **Connection String-primary key** that you [copied](#connection-string) earlier.

## Verify that Data is Flowing from your Azure Event Hub to Cribl Stream 

Before you can verify that data is reaching Cribl Stream, you must ensure that it is flowing out of your Azure Event Hub in the first place.

One option is to configure a [Datagen](https://docs.cribl.io/docs/datagens) and a [Route](https://docs.cribl.io/docs/routes) to send data to the Event Hub destination. We'll assume you have done that, or gotten data flowing from your Azure Event Hub in some other way.

1. In Cribl Stream, open the **Sources** > **Azure Event Hubs** > **Cribl Stream** page. This should show your Source, with a message confirming that it is working properly.

2. Open the **Live Data** tab. You should see the data that is flowing from your Azure Event Hub to Cribl Stream.
