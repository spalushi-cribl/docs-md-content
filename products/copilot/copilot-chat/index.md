# Use the Cribl Copilot Chatbot


The Cribl Copilot chatbot is an AI assistant designed to streamline your interaction with Cribl products and integrations. You can use the chatbot anywhere in the Cribl suite of products to get prompt responses to common issues and configuration questions. The Cribl Copilot chatbot is also available here in Cribl Docs and as an app in the Cribl community Slack workspace.

Specifically, the chatbot can help you:
* **Answer technical questions:** Detailed responses to questions about Cribl, Docker, Kubernetes, and regex
* **Troubleshoot problems:** Step-by-step solutions for common issues and errors
* **Find documentation:** Relevant content from Cribl documentation
* **Use integrations:** Assistance with setup and configuration of integrations with Docker and Kubernetes
* **Write regular expressions (regex):** Help with regex construction and debugging
* **Generate basic KQL:** In the drop-down next to the Cribl Copilot text box, select **Generate KQL**. For more advanced KQL generation in Cribl Search, see [Writing KQL queries with Cribl Copilot](/search/copilot-kql). 

## Get Started

To start using the chatbot, select the Cribl Copilot icon ![](copilot-icon.svg) at the bottom right of any page. Confirm your agreement with the usage terms, activate the feature, and start typing a question or request.

## How the Chatbot Works

The Cribl Copilot chatbot uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to combine the power of a foundational large language model (LLM) with comprehensive documentation from both Cribl docs and internal Cribl resources. 

## What the Chatbot Doesn't Do

The chatbot has no direct access to your data, so it can't answer questions like, "Where are my VPC logs?" Also, this chatbot, like any AI, is still learning. It may not answer all questions perfectly, so be sure to review responses carefully. Please provide feedback to help Cribl Copilot learn!
