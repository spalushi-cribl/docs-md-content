# Cribl Lake 4.6


This first release introduces Cribl Lake to the Cribl Suite

Cribl Lake is a long-term, full-fidelity data storage solution for IT and security data.
Cribl Lake is also [integrated with Cribl Search](/search/search-cribl-lake) so you can search and send data with ease! 

You can replay data from Cribl Lake using a dedicated [Collector Source](/stream/collectors-cribl-lake),
and easily send data to the Lake with the help of a [Cribl Lake Destination](/stream/destinations-cribl-lake).

### Cribl Copilot 

This release introduces Cribl Copilot, Cribl’s new AI assistant for Cribl.Cloud! Cribl Copilot helps you maximize efficiency without leaving Stream, Edge, Search, or Lake. To access Cribl Copilot, click the teal AI icon at the bottom right of any page. 



Note that the initial version of Cribl Copilot has the following limitations:

* To enable Cribl Copilot, a Cribl.Cloud Organization Owner or Admin must provide consent. This enables the assistant for all users in their Organization. Standard users can only access the assistant once their Organization Owner or Admin enables the feature.
* Organization Owners and Admins cannot withdraw consent from within the product. To disable Cribl Copilot, please contact Support. 
* Cribl Copilot leverages only two pieces of data when generating an answer: the documentation available on [docs.cribl.io](https://docs.cribl.io/), and whatever you type into the question box.
