# Cribl Lake 4.6.1


This first maintenance release for Cribl Lake brings the following quality-of-life improvements:

- The Dataset screen now shows additional information in the **Integrated With** column,
  giving you an overview of the Collectors and Destinations a Dataset is connected with.

- When you decrease the retention period of an existing Dataset,
  you will now see a warning informing you that shortening the retention period may result in data loss.
