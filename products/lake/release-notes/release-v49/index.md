# Cribl Lake 4.9


## New User Interface

The UI changes that have been opt-in for Enterprise customers since release 4.5 are now the default for all users.
This preview period allowed us to incorporate your feedback and optimize the layout.
The main change you'll notice is that we've decluttered the top of your browser,
consolidating most navigation in a collapsible left sidebar.
This sidebar is context-sensitive, enabling you to access product-specific options, as well as Global Settings.

## Built-in Datatypes Work with Cribl Lake Out of the Box

Cribl Search [Datatypes](/search/datatypes/) now work with Cribl Lake Datasets without requiring modification.
