# Donut Chart


Visualize your search results, using a Donut Chart.

---

**Donut** Charts summarize how a total amount is divided into numerical proportions. Use a **Donut** Chart when you want
to compare parts of a whole against the whole and its other parts, such as the distribution of operating system usage.

## Chart Settings

**Color palette:** Select the color scheme you want to use in your Chart.

## Data Settings




**Show only top N values:** An optional numerical value that sets the Chart to display only the larger values of a Dataset, with smaller values filtered out. To display the smaller values grouped into a single category, enable **Summarize other values**.  


## Legend​ Settings





**Position:** Where to display the legend relative to the chart.

**Truncate:** By default, Cribl Search truncates labels to fit your browser viewport, substituting a `...` for omitted characters. Toggle this off if you prefer to not alter labels.
