# Single Value Chart


Visualize your search results, using a Single Value Chart.

---

A **Single Value** Chart allows you to display one search result. If there is more than one result, the first result is
charted. These are helpful when you have an important value to track.

## Chart Settings

**Label**: Defaults to the field name referenced on the Chart. Select the color block to the right of the **Label**
field to choose a display color for the label and value.

**Style**: Select whether the color selected in the **Label** field appears as the background or foreground of the
Chart.

**Prefix**: Add text before the single value.

**Suffix**: Append text after the single value.

**Decimal places**: Select the number of digits to the right of a decimal point.

**Use 1000 separator (,)**: Display the single value with the `,` thousands separator. Enabled by default.

**Apply threshold**: Apply custom color threshold settings. Note that applying thresholds overwrites any color you may
have selected in the **Label** field.

Enable **Apply threshold**, and then change or add custom colors and threshold values to change the display of the
Chart.
