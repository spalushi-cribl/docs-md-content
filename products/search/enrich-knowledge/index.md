# Enrich and Automate


Use and customize Knowledge libraries to enrich your data, Macros to automate your searches, and Packs to share pre-built Cribl Search configurations.

---

You can access and manage Cribl Search Knowledge libraries and Macros by selecting **Knowledge** from the sidebar. You'll now see upper tabs where you can configure the enrichment and automation resources listed below.

- **[Lookups](lookups)** are data tables that the [`lookup`](lookup) and [`ip-lookup`](ip-lookup) operators use to enrich events with relevant geographic, identity, threat, or other details.
- **[Parsers](parsers)** in Cribl Search are definitions for [Datatypes](datatypes) and for the  [`extract`](extract-operator) operator.
- **[Regexes](regexes)** are definitions for [Parsers](parsers).
- **[Grok patterns](grok-patterns)** are definitions for [Parsers](parsers).
- **[Macros](macros)** are saved query snippets that you can reuse across different searches, providing consistency and a single point of maintenance.

Select [**Packs**](packs) from the sidebar to import, modify, create, and export pre-built Cribl Search resources. Packs can include Dashboards, saved searches, Datatypes, Macros, and lookups – in any combination required to support a given data source or workflow.
