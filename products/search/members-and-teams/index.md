# Configure Workspace Teams


Fine-tune access control within your [Workspaces](workspaces), by configuring Teams and their Members.

---

One of the main benefits of Workspaces is to efficiently provide granular control over which users have access to which parts of your Cribl Organization. You manage access by assigning Permissions to individual Members and Teams within a Workspace.

> If a Member has overlapping assigned Permissions, then their highest Permission is active.

### Members

When inviting a new user to your Organization, configure Workspace-level Permissions under **Workspace Access**.

- Select a Member Permission in the **Permission** drop-down next to the Workspace.

  When you choose the **Member** Permission, you will next configure
  [access for each Cribl product](/stream/Permissions#product) separately:




- Alternatively, select the check box next to one or more Workspaces and choose a Permission under **Set bulk
  permission**. This Permission will then be granted to the user for all selected Workspaces.




### Teams

Teams are groups of Members who share the same Workspace and product-level Permissions. Teams allow you to efficiently
control access, by assigning Permissions to the Team rather than by configuring each Member individually.

You can [share](sharing) Datasets with Teams and individual Members.

To configure a Team:

1. On the sidebar, expand **Organization** and then select **Member & Teams**.
1. Give focus to the **Team** upper tab.
1. Select **Create Team**. This displays a configuration modal.
1. Provide a meaningful **Name**, and optionally, a **Description**.
1. Select the desired Workspace, and the desired access level, to assign to the Team. (If you select the **Members** level, you can then assign granular [product-level](/stream/permissions#product) Permissions.)
1. In **Team Members**, select the Members you want to add, then **Add** them. (To appear in this drop-down, a Member must already be created with your Organization.) The table will update to show each Member you've added.
1. When finished, **Save** your new Team.

The main **Teams** tab displays the Teams configured on your Workspace. You can **Edit** or delete these, as needed, from the
**Actions** column.
