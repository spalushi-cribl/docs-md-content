Visualize your search results, using a Funnel Chart.

---

A **Funnel** Chart helps visualize how data values move through a process in stages. **Funnel** Charts are useful for
monitoring data that moves through a linear process in sequential, connected stages.

## Chart Settings

**Color palette:** Select the color scheme you want to use in your Chart.

## Data Settings




**Show only top N values:** An optional numerical value that sets the Chart to display only the larger values of a Dataset, with smaller values filtered out. To display the smaller values grouped into a single category, enable **Summarize other values**.  


## Legend​ Settings





**Position:** Where to display the legend relative to the chart.

**Truncate:** By default, Cribl Search truncates labels to fit your browser viewport, substituting a `...` for omitted characters. Toggle this off if you prefer to not alter labels.
