# Cribl Search 4.3.1


## New Features

### Query Language

The new [eventstats operator](eventstats) allows you to enrich events with aggregated data.

The new [dedup operator](dedup) lets you efficiently remove duplicate events.

[Commands](commands) allow you to manage searches and view Dataset objects by running a search, these include:
* [`.show queries`](show-queries) to display queued or running searches.
* [`.cancel queries`](cancel-queries) to stop queued or running searches.
* [`.show objects`](show-objects) to list objects included in a Dataset.

The [export operator](export) now supports appending data to lookup files, in addition to the existing create and overwrite options. 

Certain [member permissions](cloud-managing#search-member-roles) now restrict access to the `export` and `send` operators, as well as the newly introduced commands: `.show` and `.cancel` for search management.

### Notifications

[Scheduled searches](scheduled-searches) now support sending notifications to [Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topics](notification-targets#amazon-sns) and [Slack](notification-targets#slack).

### Data

[Virtual tables](virtual-tables) enhance system observability by providing access to system definitions and properties through search queries. Unlike Datasets, these tables are dynamically generated by Cribl Search. 

### Visualizations

[Results tables](results-table-settings#apply-column-formatting) have a new column formatting option to define the **Format** as a **Number**, **Percentage**, or **Currency**.
