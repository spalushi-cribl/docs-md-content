# Cribl Search 4.1.2


## New Features

### Scheduled Searches

We are excited to announce **Scheduled Searches**. With Scheduled Searches, you can configure searches to run automatically at predetermined times, allowing you to analyze the results when you need them, without having to wait for the search to complete. In addition to viewing results locally in Search, you can automatically send the results to Cribl Stream using the **send** operator, enabling further routing and filtering of your data.

This feature is especially useful for aggregating data over several time periods, comparing results from different time periods, identifying anomalies, and analyzing long-term trends. By automating your searches, you can save time and streamline your analysis process.

### Data Enrichment

**Lookups** are CSV data tables that are referenced using the lookup operator to enrich your events. With Lookups, you can quickly and easily integrate external data to enhance your analysis and get more insights. Additionally, this helps streamline your analysis process, as you'll no longer need to manually search for additional data sources to enrich your events.

### Dataset Providers

We've added several new **Dataset Providers** so you can easily connect and retrieve the data you need for your analysis.
* Azure Blob
* API Search – These are in active development and are subject to change.
    * AWS
    * Okta
    * Zoom
