# Cribl Search 4.9.1


Starting with Cribl Search 4.9.1, you can authenticate to Azure Blob Storage by using a Client Secret, add
visualizations through Cribl Copilot, and use a new context function, `displayUsername()`. This maintenance release also
brings a range of improvements to product performance, the user interface, Dashboards, and more.



## Client Secret Authentication for Azure Blob Storage

When adding an Azure Blob Storage Dataset Provider, you can now use the [Client Secret](set-up-azure-blob#client-secret)
authentication method, in addition to the existing authentication methods.

## Cribl Copilot Visualization Assistant

When creating or editing a dashboard, you can now use [Cribl Copilot](/copilot/copilot-dashboards) to add visualizations.

## New Context Function: `displayUsername()`

The new `displayUsername()` [context function](context-functions) returns the friendly display name of the user who
created the search.

## Quickly Access Recent Dashboards

You can now quickly open your most recent Dashboards from any Cribl Suite product. On the top bar, select **Products**,
then hover over **Dashboards.**
