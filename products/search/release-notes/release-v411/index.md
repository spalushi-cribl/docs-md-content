# Cribl Search 4.1.1


## New Features

### Enhanced User Experience

The setup for searching from a Cribl Stream **Data Lake Amazon S3 Destination** is now easier. You'll have a list of Cribl Stream Destinations to choose from that Cribl Search uses to automatically populate your AWS credentials and bucket path when configuring a Dataset Provider and Dataset.

A new **render** operator allows you to easily display results on the Chart tab and take advantage of all the visualization settings available.

We've added two new aggregation functions, **list** and **values**, to help you gain deeper insights into your data.
* **values** – returns all the distinct values of a field, making it easy for you to identify and understand the various values that exist in your data.
* **list** – returns the list of values of a field, allowing you to quickly access all the values associated with that field.
