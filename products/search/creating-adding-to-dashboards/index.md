# Create a Dashboard


Learn how to create a Dashboard in Cribl Search.

---

You can create new [Dashboards](dashboards) or add to existing Dashboards in several ways.

## Create Dashboard From the Dashboards Tab {#dashboards-tab}

On the Dashboards page, you can create a new Dashboard and add visualization panels.

1. From the Cribl Search sidebar, select **Dashboards**.
1. Select **Add Dashboard**.
1. Give your new Dashboard a name and (optionally) a description.
1. Optionally, select or create a [**Collection**](managing-sharing-dashboards#group-dashboards-into-collections) to contain this
   Dashboard.
1. Optionally, configure a **Schedule** to automatically refresh your Dashboard at a set interval.<br>For more details
   on Dashboard scheduling, see [Refresh Your Dashboards Automatically](editing-dashboards#autorefresh).
1. When your basic configuration is complete, select **Save**.

### Add Visualizations to a Dashboard {#adding-visualizations}

In the empty Dashboard that appears next, you'll see the following options:

- **Add Visualization Using Copilot**: This prompts you to specify a Dataset, and then prompts the Cribl Copilot AI to
  suggest visualizations for that Dataset. For details, see
  [Add a Visualization when Creating a Dashboard](copilot-dashboards#creating).
- **Add Visualization**: This prompts you to specify a new or saved search, and then define a corresponding chart type.
  For details, see [New Search](editing-dashboards#new) and [Existing Search](editing-dashboards#existing).
- **Add Input**: This prompts you to define a visualization panel constrainted by a new or saved search, a range of
  values or numbers, a time range, or freeform text. For details, see [Add Inputs to Your Cribl Search Dashboard](dashboard-inputs).
- **Add Markdown**: This prompts you to define a visualization panel that offers users explanations or instructions on
  using your Dashboard. You can use markdown formatting to add arbitrary text, tables, and/or images. For details, see
  [Add Markdown](editing-dashboards#add-markdown).

The three last options above are also available on the **Add** drop-down at the upper right. To get suggestions from
Cribl Copilot after you've configured a Dashboard, see
[Add a Visualization when Editing a Dashboard](copilot-dashboards#editing).

## Create Dashboard From the Products Sidebar {#products-sidebar}

You can create a new Dashboard from the **Products** sidebar, too:

1. Select **Products** on the top bar.
1. In the **Products** sidebar, under **Search**, hover over **Dashboards** and select the **+** button.
1. In the **New Dashboard** modal, give your new Dashboard a name and (optionally) a description.
1. Optionally, select or create a [**Collection**](managing-sharing-dashboards#group-dashboards-into-collections) to contain this Dashboard.

After performing a search, you can add it as a visualization panel to a new or existing
Dashboard.

1. Select the **Actions** drop-down, and select **Add to Dashboard**.
1. Select whether you want to add the visualization to a new or existing Dashboard.
1. Select or name the Dashboard.
1. Enter the **Panel title**. This will be the name of the visualization panel in your Dashboard.
1. Select **Add & Go to Dashboard**.

## Create Dashboard From the History or Saved Tab {#history-saved}

Both in **History** and **Saved Searches**, you can turn any search in the list into a visualization panel, and add it
to a new or existing Dashboard.

1. Select the Actions ![](actions-dropdown.light.svg) button to the right of a search and select **Add to Dashboard**.
1. Select whether you want to add the visualization to a new or existing Dashboard.
1. Select or name the Dashboard.

1. Select **Add & Go to Dashboard**.


> Wondering about the difference between saving a search and adding a search to a Dashboard? A saved search is a query that can be rerun to return new or updated data. You can add saved searches to Dashboards in the form of visualization panels. All saved searches are available to add to Dashboards, but adding a search to a Dashboard does not add it to the **Saved Searches** list.
