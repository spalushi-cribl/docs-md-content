# Manage and Share Dashboards


Collect, export, and share your Cribl Search Dashboards.

---

You can create custom Collections to group [Dashboards](dashboards) together. You can export Dashboard visualization panels as image
files. And you can share any Dashboard that you own.

## Group Dashboards into Collections {#collections}

You can create custom Collections in which to organize groups of Dashboards.

On the Dashboards page, select **Add Collection**, give your Collection a unique name, and then select **Add**. New Collections appear in the list on the left, in alphabetical order.

You can also create a Collection when [creating a new Dashboard](creating-adding-to-dashboards#dashboards-tab).

Add Dashboards to Collections by selecting a Collection name from the **Collection** drop-down in either the **Edit Dashboard** modal (when editing an existing Dashboard) or the **New Dashboard** modal (when adding a new Dashboard).

Move a Dashboard that you own by clicking the Dashboard’s Actions ![](actions-dropdown.light.svg) button and selecting **Move**.

Rename or delete a Collection by clicking the button next to the Collection name.

> Moving a Dashboard generally discards any sharing Permissions that were set on the original Dashboard. (However, moving a Dashboard **between** Collections does not change its access Permissions.) Share the Dashboard from its new location to add new Permissions.
