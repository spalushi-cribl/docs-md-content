# Share Diagnostics


Share a diagnostic bundle with Cribl Support, to help us solve your issue.

---

A diagnostic bundle contains a snapshot of configuration files and logs at the time the bundle was created, and gives troubleshooters insights into how Cribl Search was configured and operating at that time.

## Generate a Diag File​ 

1. From **Search Home**, load the problematic search into the query box.
1. Select **Details** to open this search in a **Details** modal.
1. From the **Diagnostics** drop-down, select either **Include Results** or **Exclude Results**. This will download the corresponding search details and logs as a .tgz file whose name is a generously long hash.

>For details about whether to include or exclude results, see [Diagnostics](search-details#diagnostics).

## Submit Diags​
