The `$vt_object_list_summary` virtual table lists Datasets that contain Cribl Search metadata.

```kusto {runSearch=true}
// returns a list of all Datasets that contain Cribl Search metadata and are available to the current user
dataset="$vt_object_list_summary"
```

## Purpose

Use `$vt_object_list` to find out which Datasets contain Cribl Search
[metadata](commands#generate-metadata-for-a-dataset) (for example, generated by the
[`.generate metadata`](generate-metadata) command). Searching those Datasets can be more efficient.
