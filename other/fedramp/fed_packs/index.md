The Cribl Federal Packs Dispensary offers a curated selection of data processing solutions tailored for government use cases. This in-product dispensary restricts its contents to Packs that are authored and published by Cribl, and that have undergone our internal review and publishing standards. This curated approach helps Federal agencies rapidly deploy common workflows – including data transformation, routing, enrichment, and reduction – while aligning with strict security and compliance requirements.

## Access to Cribl Commercial Packs

You can import Packs from the commercial [Cribl Packs Dispensary](https://packs.cribl.io) if there's content you'd like to use. However, the in-product browser within Cribl.Cloud Government displays only Cribl-authored content by default, and does not show third-party community contributions. If you need community-generated content, visit the commercial Cribl Packs Dispensary directly to download and then upload the desired Packs.  

> It is your responsibility to thoroughly review and understand the security risks associated with community-generated content before importing and deploying such Packs within your Cribl.Cloud Government environment.
