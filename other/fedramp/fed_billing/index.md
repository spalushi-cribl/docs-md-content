## Cribl.Cloud Government Pricing
Cribl has introduced dedicated SKUs for Cribl.Cloud Government to differentiate the FedRAMP Moderate offering from the commercial offering. These specialized SKUs simplify procurement and clarify compliance for government agencies.

Pricing aligns with the commercial consumption-based model, where costs are based on usage. For the Cribl.Cloud Government environment, our consumption-based pricing model reflects the additional security and operational value provided. 

## FinOps Center

The FinOps Center in Cribl.Cloud Government provides a unified, integrated view of data flow costs and credit consumption.
