This document details the Cribl.Cloud Government authentication framework. It outlines the technical controls and policies that govern user access, identity integration, and security compliance.

## Secure Access and Authentication

Cribl.Cloud Government provides Federal customers with a comprehensive security framework designed specifically to meet the stringent requirements of government agencies.

### Authentication Architecture

Cribl.Cloud Government delivers a robust authentication system built on Federal security standards:

* **Dedicated authentication endpoints**: Agency-specific URLs specifically designed for secure login to the Cribl.Cloud Government environment.
* **Customizable authentication workflows**: Tailored processes that allow agencies to integrate their specific identity management rules and policies.
* **Isolated Cribl.Cloud Government security boundaries**: A logical separation of the government cloud from the commercial cloud, ensuring data and access remain within a secure, compliant environment.

### Flexible Identity Integration
The platform supports a variety of integrations with government-approved identity providers, including:
* SAML 2.0 (Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0) integration with FedRAMP-authorized Identity Providers (IdPs).
* Just-in-time user provisioning.
* Role/attribute mapping from agency directories.
* Support for Personal Identity Verification (PIV) and Common Access Card (CAC) is configured and managed through the customer's SSO provider, not as a direct feature of a Cribl-issued account.

### FIPS Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Requirements
Any user logging in directly through the Cribl.Cloud Government built-in Identity Provider (IdP) must use a FIPS-compliant 2FA method.

The following authenticator types are supported, but must be compliant with FIPS 140-2:

- **FIDO2 (WebAuthn)**: Must be a FIPS-certified security key.
- **Passkey alternatives**: Passkeys generated by a FIPS-approved vault manager or password manager.

Once an admin sets up Single Sign-On (SSO), users will authenticate using the 2FA rules and devices mandated by your commercial IdP. Any users who continue to access the platform directly via the built-in IdP must adhere to the FIPS 2FA requirement.

### Comprehensive Security Policies

Cribl.Cloud Government implements Federal-grade security policies:

* **Strong password requirements:** 15+ characters with complexity requirements.
* **Credential rotation:** 60-day password expiration cycles.
* **Account protection:** Three-attempt lockout policy.
* **Dormancy controls:** 90-day inactivity suspension.
* **Session management:** 15-minute administrative console timeouts.

### API Keys

For system integrations and automation, Cribl.Cloud Government supports:
- API keys
- OAuth 2.0 authentication
- Service accounts with least privilege

These features are technically consistent with the commercial Cribl.Cloud offering. For details on programmatic configuration, refer to the [Cribl as Code Docs](/cribl-as-code/).

Agencies may configure additional controls through their identity provider and are responsible for managing their own credential rotation policies to meet compliance requirements, such as the recommended 90-day rotation.

### Security Monitoring & Compliance

Ensure a secure and compliant environment with the following built-in features:

* Comprehensive authentication event logging
* Full session activity audit trails
* Authentication metrics and reporting
* Compliance documentation for Federal audits
