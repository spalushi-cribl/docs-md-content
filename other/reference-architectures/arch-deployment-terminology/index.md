# Deployment Terminology

This section breaks down the key terms and concepts you need to know to talk about and build Cribl setups.

|<div style="width: 100px"> Deployment Model</div>| What It Is | How It Works (The Technical Stuff) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Cribl.Cloud Hosted | A deployment model where Cribl components are provisioned and managed within a public cloud infrastructure (AWS/Azure) using the Cribl.Cloud (SaaS) service. | <ul><li> Cribl provisions infrastructure using Cloud APIs.</li><li> Networking and security are handled through cloud-native tools (VPCs, firewalls, and others). </li><li> Identity is tied to cloud services like AWS IAM. </li><li>Data is stored in cloud object storage (S3, Azure Blob, and others). </li><li>Access to Cribl Search and Cribl Lake. |
| On-prem or Customer-managed | A deployment model where all Cribl components are hosted within customer-controlled infrastructure, including physical data centers, private clouds, or customer-managed virtualization platforms. | <ul><li>Download and run Cribl software on your own infrastructure. </li><li>You manage the hardware and virtual machines directly. </li><li>You're in charge of all networking and security. </li><li>You use your own local storage systems.</li><li>  It integrates with your existing company identity systems.</li><li> You control the placement and sizing of all components. </li><li>Cribl Search and Cribl Lake are not available. |
| Hybrid | A flexible deployment that combines cloud-hosted and on-prem components, all managed from a single, centralized control plane in Cribl.Cloud. | <ul><li>The Cribl.Cloud Leader serves as your centralized control plane.</li><li> Worker Nodes that process your data can be anywhere: in Cribl.Cloud, on public/private cloud instances you manage, or in your own data centers. </li><li>This setup makes it easy to expand your observability into new cloud regions or replace physical data centers without losing centralized control.</li><li>  You can add or reassign Worker Nodes and Edge Nodes using simple, auto-generated command-line scripts from the UI. Access to Cribl Search and Cribl Lake. |
